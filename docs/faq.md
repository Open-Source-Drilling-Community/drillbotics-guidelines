# FAQ (Active)

This page answers common questions for the current competition year. For the 2024 archived FAQ, see Archive → 2024 → FAQ.

## Can I still access the 2024 rules and FAQ?

Yes. Use the version switcher in the header to select 2024, or open Archive → 2024 → FAQ.

## Where do I find the latest rules?

All canonical content lives in this site under the relevant sections (Competition, Tracks). The header shows the active version.

## How do I propose a change or clarification?

Open a pull request that edits the relevant Markdown under `docs/`, and add a short note to `docs/changelog.md` describing the change. The Guidelines Committee will review.

## Are PDFs the source of truth?

No. PDFs may be attached for reference, but the Markdown pages here are authoritative.
