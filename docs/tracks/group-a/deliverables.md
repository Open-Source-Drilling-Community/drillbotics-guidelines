# Mode Virtual (V) — Deliverables

Phase I — Design (2023–2024):

- Monthly reports: due on or before the final day of each month starting in October (short progress update, issues/risks, next steps).
- Phase I Design Report: due 31 Dec 2023, midnight UTC. Use “2024 <School Abbrev> Phase I Design Report” as the filename prefix.
- Optional Design Video: ≤ 5 minutes, due by 23 Jan 2026 (property of the university; DSATS may use in sites/events).
- Finalists announced: early February 2026.

Phase II — Implementation and testing:

- Mode Virtual: model enhancement/testing and controls development; Phase II test occurs May/June 2024.
- Pre‑recorded team presentation: submitted ~1 week before the test; judges prepare Q&A from it.

Data and documentation packages (Directional challenge excerpts):

- Minimum Curvature trajectory and plan‑vs‑actual plots (TVD vs. VS, vertical section, plan view).
- Directional survey raw data logs with timestamps, measured depth, downhole sensor values (axes + qualifier values), and survey acceptance flags.
- Formation model import: prepared to ingest DSATS‑provided rock model immediately before Phase II.

File naming convention:

- Monthly report: “YYYY‑MM <School Abbrev>” (e.g., 2024‑10 UDC)
- Design report: “2024 <School Abbrev> Phase I Design Report”
