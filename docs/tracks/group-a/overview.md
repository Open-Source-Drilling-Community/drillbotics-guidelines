# Group A — Virtual (Overview)

Group A offers two challenge options for 2023–2024, both focused on virtual drilling and controls:

- Option 1 — Directional drilling: Design a control system that virtually controls a full‑scale drilling system model to drill a 2D or optional 3D trajectory through three targets provided just before Phase II.
- Option 2 — Well control: Use the D‑WIS interface to connect to the OpenLab Drilling Simulator and detect/control an influx (kick).

Recommended starting point (from the 2024 guidelines): new Group A teams are highly encouraged to use the OpenLab Drilling Simulator (<https://openlab.app/>) and focus on the control system. The D‑WIS interface sends setpoints to the simulator and receives surface and downhole measurements. Webinar training is available in October.

Phases and timing (per 2024 guidelines):

- Phase I — Design: monthly updates from October; Phase I Design Report due 31 Dec 2023 (midnight UTC); optional Design Video due 15 Jan; finalists announced in early/mid‑February 2024.
- Phase II — Implementation/testing: model enhancement and controls development; final Phase II test in May/June 2024.

See the subpages for the connectivity and data specifications, submission requirements, and scoring rubrics.
