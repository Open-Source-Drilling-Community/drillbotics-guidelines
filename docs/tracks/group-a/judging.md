# Group A — Judging

Scoring criteria are defined in the 2024 guidelines and differ slightly by challenge. Judges may award bonus points for “above and beyond” achievements.

3D steering challenge:

| Category | Example metrics | Weight |
|---|---|---:|
| Drilling system model | Steering method and geometry; bit side force/tilt; new wellbore; string elasticity; wellbore friction | 30 |
| Control scheme | Realistic constraints; realistic virtual measurements; uncertainty/noise; re‑planning to target; basic drilling optimization; rig control modes | 30 |
| Virtual drilling app | Features, modularity, robustness; real‑time display; end‑of‑well report | 20 |
| Performance | Demonstration and degree to which objectives are met | 20 |
| Bonus | Above‑and‑beyond work | 10 |
| Total (max) |  | 110 |

Well control challenge:

| Category | Example metrics | Weight |
|---|---|---:|

| Virtual drilling app | Features, modularity, robustness; real‑time display; end‑of‑well report | 30 |
| Control scheme | Realistic constraints; realistic virtual measurements; uncertainty/noise | 20 |
| Bonus | Above‑and‑beyond work | 10 |
| Total (max) |  | 110 |
