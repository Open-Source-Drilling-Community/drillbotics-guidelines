# Deliverables

Use the tabs to see deliverables by track.

!!! warning "Deadlines"
    Always confirm dates on the [Timeline & Milestones](../competition/timeline.md) page.

!!! note "Edge‑deployable models"
    Teams may prototype with larger cloud‑hosted models, but final deliverables and performance are evaluated using small, locally run models under limited inference hardware. See Competition → [Rules & Scoring](../competition/rules-scoring.md) for constraints and offline requirements.
