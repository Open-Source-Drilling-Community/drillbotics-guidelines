# Mode Physical (P) â€” Autonomy & Control

Automation requirements (per 2024 guidelines):

- Mode switching: automate drilling/survey mode transitions (built-in survey interval; on/off-bottom; slide/rotation switching with appropriate string movement).
- Steering: compute toolface direction, slide length, and other steering requirements autonomously. Human intervention to place/retrieve mechanisms (e.g., whipstock) is allowed, but orientation must be system-computed and displayed.
- Surveying: fully autonomous surveying and autonomous survey qualification; secondary human verification/override is allowed and must be flagged.
- Monitoring: compute and display dogleg severity, and distance/direction to plan at each survey station on the rig display.
- Control architecture: document measurement/aggregation latencies and controller update rates; design for robust closed-loop control using downhole data.
