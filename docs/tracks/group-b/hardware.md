# Mode Physical (P) — Hardware

Expectations from the 2024 guidelines:

- Power: provide a table of expected electrical power consumption for major devices (rotation, hoist, pump, controls, displays, etc.), including voltage, current, phase, and estimated HP/W. This supports booth planning if the rig is displayed at the Drilling Conference.
- Dimensions: provide a diagram of maximum rig dimensions when operational (including auxiliaries) to verify venue/booth fit.
- Shipping: calculate the “Chargeable Weight” including crates/boxes; include dimensional‑weight calculations per common carrier rules.
- Sensors: specify surface and downhole sensor packages, verification/calibration methods (accuracy, precision, frequency response, environmental stability), and placement. Include plans for along‑string sensing where applicable.
- Data acquisition: define sampling rates, synchronization across surface/downhole streams, and data handling pipelines.

!!! tip "Recommended"
    Provide clear power tables, rig dimension diagrams, and shipping calculations up front to streamline venue planning and logistics.
