# Group B — Physical (Overview)

Group B challenges teams to build and operate a small‑scale drilling rig and control system to autonomously drill a directional well. Core characteristics from the 2024 guidelines:

- Directional objective: hit three targets provided immediately before the Phase II test; trajectories may be 2D or optional 3D within bounded inclination/azimuth/displacement limits.
- Downhole sensors: mandatory, and their data must be integrated into closed‑loop control of the rig.
- Autonomy: drilling/survey mode switching, steering calculations (e.g., toolface, slide length), survey qualification, and DLS/plan deltas must be computed autonomously and shown on the rig display.

See the subpages for safety requirements, hardware expectations, deliverables/testing, and judging rubrics.
