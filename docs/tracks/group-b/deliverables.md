# Group B — Deliverables & Testing

Phase I — Design (2023–2024):

- Monthly reports: due on or before the final day of each month starting in October.
- Phase I Design Report: due 31 Dec 2023, midnight UTC; use the naming convention “2024 <School Abbrev> Phase I Design Report”.
- Optional Design Video: ≤ 5 minutes, due by 23 Jan 2026.
- Finalists announced: early February 2026.

Phase II — Implementation and testing:

- Group B: model & controls development and rig construction; Phase II test occurs May/June 2024.
- Pre‑recorded team presentation: submitted ~1 week before the test; judges prepare Q&A from it.

Required artifacts (Magnetic surveying excerpts):

- Definitive directional survey (TXT/LAS/CSV) including header info such as school name, survey date, well center (WGS‑84), TVD reference (above block), grid convergence, geomagnetic model, magnetic declination, total azimuth correction, field dip/strength references, and the error model used.
- Autonomous survey process and qualification; provide raw survey data logs with timestamps, measured depth, downhole sensor values (axes + qualifier values), and survey acceptance indicators.

Testing notes:

- Closed‑loop control using downhole data is mandatory; failure to integrate downhole measurements into the controller is considered failing for 2024.
- Prepare a test matrix, data handling and visualization plans, and calibration/verification procedures for sensors and instrumentation.
