# Mode Physical (P) — Judging

Judging spans both the design phase and the final test. The 2024 guidelines define the categories below; detailed weightings are in the source document.

Phase I (design) categories:

- Safety
- Mobility of rig (rig up/move/rig down)
- Design considerations and lessons learned (analysis, concepts, development)
- Mechanical design and functionality/versatility (problem/goal, criteria, feasibility)
- Simulation/model/algorithm
- Control scheme

Phase II (build/test) categories:

- Creative ability; engineering skills; construction quality; cost control
- Performance (e.g., ROP, MSE, landing bit, inclination; proximity to target X/Y and depth; Go/No‑Go flexible “casing”; verticality, tortuosity, caliper)
- Data (handling, visualization, comparison with judges’ logs)
- Downhole sensor data used in the control algorithm
- Intangibles and pass/fail checks

Note: Bonus points may be added or subtracted at judges’ discretion. See 2024/group-b.md for specific weights and examples extracted from the PDF.
