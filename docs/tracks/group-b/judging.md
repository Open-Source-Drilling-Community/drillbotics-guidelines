# Mode Physical (P) — Judging

!!! info "2025.1 rubric summary"
    See Competition → Rules & Scoring for the current 2025.1 weights and the optional Edge‑AI Bonus. This page retains 2024 reference categories for context.

!!! tip "Algorithm‑agnostic"
    Credit is based on outcomes and evidence; architecture choice (mechanical/control/ML/LLM) is not scored directly, provided constraints and safety are met.

!!! note "Innovation Uplift"
    Judges may award top‑of‑band within categories for documented novel contributions (mechanical design, sensing, safety engineering, UI/HF overlays, calibration tooling, data quality pipelines, model compression/efficiency) that improve outcomes, safety, or clarity. This does not exceed category maxima.

!!! note "Small multimodal LLMs encouraged"
    Teams may prototype with larger cloud models, but final deliverables and performance are evaluated using small, locally run models under limited inference hardware (e.g., ≤2 vCPU or ≤20 W GPU, ≤4–8 GB RAM, ≤10 min compute time (non-llm) or ≤8 vCPU ≤1,150 W GPU, ≤16–64 GB RAM (LLM) ≤15 min inference runtime). AI runs may be online during judging; interop checks are read‑only/shadow (no PLC writes).

Judging spans both the design phase and the final test. The 2024 guidelines define the categories below; detailed weightings are in the source document.

Phase I (design) categories:

- Safety
- Mobility of rig (rig up/move/rig down)
- Design considerations and lessons learned (analysis, concepts, development)
- Mechanical design and functionality/versatility (problem/goal, criteria, feasibility)
- Simulation/model/algorithm
- Control scheme

Phase II (build/test) categories:

- Creative ability; engineering skills; construction quality; cost control
- Performance (e.g., ROP, MSE, landing bit, inclination; proximity to target X/Y and depth; Go/No‑Go flexible “casing”; verticality, tortuosity, caliper)
- Data (handling, visualization, comparison with judges’ logs)
- Downhole sensor data used in the control algorithm
- Intangibles and pass/fail checks

Note: Bonus points may be added or subtracted at judges’ discretion. See 2024/group-b.md for specific weights and examples extracted from the PDF.
