# Mode Physical (P) — Safety & Risk

The 2024 guidelines require a comprehensive safety case: safety of personnel, equipment, and the environment is paramount. Judges grade each team’s plan and implementation.

Key expectations:

- Safety plan: identify foreseeable hazards and mitigations beyond PPE, including handling rock, rotating machinery, electrical shock, and communication during operations. Keep the plan current throughout the project.
- Guards and interlocks: rigs often spin components at high RPM; include protective covers/shields so loose parts cannot become projectiles. Provide emergency stops and appropriate interlocks.
- Lab practices: supervision, lockout/tagout where applicable, and safe test procedures.

This safety case applies to both tracks; Mode Physical (P) carries additional risk due to physical equipment. See also Competition → Safety for general principles.
