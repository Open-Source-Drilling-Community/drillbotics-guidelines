# Safety (General)

Baseline expectations that apply to all teams, venues, and modes.

- Lab conduct and supervision: follow institutional policies; make sure adequate oversight for any powered testing.
- Electrical and mechanical safety: enclose rotating parts; provide guards/shields; use appropriate fusing, grounding, and LOTO where applicable.
- Emergency stops and interlocks: clearly labeled, tested E‑Stops are required for physical equipment; verify interlock behavior before demos.
- Procedures and training: maintain a written safety plan; brief the team before each test; log incidents and near‑misses.
- Data privacy and OpSec: keep credentials and control endpoints private; do not expose unsafe remote control pathways. Never commit secrets to public repos.
- AI and automation: any AI components must run offline for judging; no PLC/actuator writes during “read‑only/shadow” interop checks.

Track‑specific details are on the respective pages:

- Mode Physical (P) — Safety & Risk: ../../tracks/group-b/safety.md
- Mode Virtual (V) — general safety is minimal; still follow lab policies for any hardware‑in‑the‑loop setups.

!!! warning "Safety first"
    Always follow local regulations and lab procedures before operating equipment. Judges will grade both your safety plan and its implementation.
