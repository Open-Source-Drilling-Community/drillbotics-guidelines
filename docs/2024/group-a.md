### Introduction

> This year marks the tenth competition for the title of Drillbotics®
> champion and a chance for students to learn about the drilling process
> from industry experts and for winning team(s) to travel and present a
> paper at the next SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and at an event
> organized by DSATS. The past years involved undergraduates, masters
> and doctoral students from a variety of disciplines who built
> innovative drilling machines and downhole tools while developing a
> deeper understanding of automating the drilling process. Recently,
> this was extended to include teams who created models of the rig, the
> drilling process, and various downhole interactions. Teams freely
> shared lessons learned, which more rapidly advances the science of
> drilling automation. Everyone involved claims to have had a lot of fun
> while learning things that are not in the textbooks or published
> papers. Students also participated in related events at conferences,
> workshop meetings and networking with industry leaders in drilling
> automation. This year’s contest promises to be just as challenging and
> hopefully as much fun. For more information, see
> <https://drillbotics.com/>
>
> This year’s Group A competition again allows teams two options. They
> may compete like previous years, virtually drilling a directional
> well. Optionally, they may choose to focus on virtually detecting and
> controlling a well control event (e.g., kick). Group B will drill a
> 2-dimensional directional well under similar guidelines to last year,
> but may opt to drill a 3-dimensional well.
>
> New for 2024
>
> Continue with two groups
>
> A – Virtual
>
> B – Physical
>
> Separate guidelines for each group to reduce confusion
>
> Group A:
>
> - Create model (or option to use publicly available models) to simulate a virtual rig, or
>
> - Use their rig model to interface with a well control model provided by Norce using their OpenLab simulator.
>
> Group B:
>
> - Build and operate a physical rig to drill a 2D directional well or an optional 3D well.
>
> For A & B: Additional credit for teams that develop a D-WIS compatible API for data interoperability.
>
> Okay for two schools to join together for their entry.
>
> New Group A teams are highly encouraged to use the OpenLab Drilling
> Simulator ([https://openlab.app/](https://openlab.app/)) and
> focus on designing the controls system. The D-WIS interface and
> connectivity will be used to send set-points to the simulator and
> receive surface and downhole sensor data. Webinar training on how to
> use the D-WIS interface and the simulator will be provided in October.
> Group B teams could use the simulator to validate and verify the
> interoperability of their API.
>
> Previously, teams reviewing the contest rules had to jump between the
> main body of the guidelines to various appendices depending on which
> group they chose. This year we have created separate guidelines for
> Groups A and B. The general information items that are common to both
> groups are identical. Rules specific to each group are listed in an
> appendix. Teams must also monitor the website
> ([www.Drillbotics.com](https://drillbotics.com)) to check
> any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) since they become part of these
> guidelines.
>
> How did the competition first come about? The origins began in 2008
> when several SPE members established the Drilling Systems Automation
> Technical Section (DSATS) to help accelerate the uptake of automation
> in the drilling industry. DSATS’ goal was to link the surface machines
> with downhole machines, tools, and measurements in drilling systems
> automation (DSA), thereby improving drilling safety and efficiency.
> Later, at an SPE Forum in Paris, the idea of a student competition
> began to take shape; a DSATS sub-committee was formed to develop the
> competition format and guidelines further. Several universities were
> polled to find out the ability of academic institutions to create and
> manage multi-disciplinary teams. The Drillbotics committee began small
> in 2014-2015 to see if the format could succeed. With fine tuning, we
> continue along those lines as we start the 2024 process.

**Competition Overview:**

> Group A

- Option 1: The teams will design a control system that will virtually
  control their full-scale drilling system model to test and demonstrate
  their automated system’s capability to drill a directional well. The
  teams should incorporate virtual downhole and surface sensors in their
  automation and controls scheme. The well path will be defined by three
  targets provided by the Drillbotics Committee immediately before the
  final Phase II test. Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D
  trajectory.

-

- Option 2: Teams may use the D-WIS interface standard to connect to an
  OpenLab simulator offered by Norce to detect and control an influx
  (kick).

> Group B

- The challenge requires teams to develop a small-scale drilling rig and
  control system to autonomously drill a directional well following a
  given trajectory.

- Downhole sensors are mandatory, and their data must be included in the
  control algorithms.

- The well path will be defined by three targets provided by the
  Drillbotics Committee immediately before the final Phase II test.
  Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D trajectory.

> Phase I

- Both groups must submit a Phase I Design Report not later than 31
  December.

- A Phase I Design Video is optional, due not later than 15 January.

- Judges will review the reports and select finalists to be announced in
  early February.

> Phase II

- Teams will submit a pre-recorded team presentation approximately one
  week before the Phase II test. Judges will review the presentation and
  prepare a list of questions that will be asked of each team prior to
  the physical test.

> Tests

- Group A and B Phase II tests will be held on separate dates, to be
  advised in April. If possible, we will hold face-to-face tests in
  Germany and the USA, with an option for a virtual meeting on the same
  dates.

> The DSATS technical section believes that this challenge benefits
> students in several ways.  Petroleum, mechanical, electrical, and
> control engineers gain hands-on experience in each person’s area of
> expertise that forms a solid foundation for post-graduate careers.
> Those involved with system modeling gain insight into how models can
> gain sufficient fidelity to be applied to industry specific problems.
> They also learn where poor models or poor data can lead to incorrect
> outcomes. Students also develop experience working in
> multi-disciplinary teams, which is essential in today’s
> technology-driven industries.  Winning teams must possess a variety of
> skills.  The mechanical and electrical engineers need to build a
> stable, reliable, and functional drilling rig.  Control engineers need
> to architect a system for real-time control, including a selection of
> sensors, data handling, and fast-acting control algorithms.  The
> petroleum engineers need an understanding of drilling dysfunctions and
> mitigation techniques.  Modeling engineers must understand all of
> these basics and how to organize numerous modules into a complex
> model. Everyone must work collectively to establish functional system
> requirements, often fully understood by each team member to accurately
> portray the drilling issues and create an integrated package working
> seamlessly together.
>
> The oil and gas industry today seeks lower costs and reduced risk
> through efficiency and innovation.  Many student competitors may
> discover innovative tools and control processes that will assist
> drillers in speeding the time to drill and complete a well.  This
> includes more than a faster ROP, such as problem avoidance for
> dysfunctions like excessive vibrations, stuck pipe, and wellbore
> stability issues.  Student teams built new downhole tools using 3D
> printing techniques of designs that would be difficult, if not
> impossible to machine.  They used creative hoisting and lowering
> systems.  Teams modeled drilling performance in particular formations
> and adjusted the drilling parameters accordingly for changing downhole
> conditions.  While they have a lot to learn about our business, we
> have a lot to learn about their fresh approach to today’s problems.
> Good Luck!

### Objectives for the 2022 Competition

1. During the school year, beginning in the fall of 2023, a team of
    students will organize themselves to solve a drilling-related
    problem outlined in Appendix A below. The team should preferably be
    a multi-disciplinary team that will bring unique skills to the group
    to allow them to design and construct hardware, software and models
    to demonstrate that they understand the underlying physics, the
    drilling issues and the usual means to mitigate the issues. We
    cannot stress enough the need to involve students with different
    technical training and backgrounds. They will need to develop skills
    to understand drilling dysfunctions and mitigation strategies, but
    they must also have the mechanical engineering and controls
    capabilities to model, design the rig/drilling package and develop
    the controls system. Even when the project involves only software,
    an understanding of the physical limits of a rig’s machinery and
    tubulars is critical. In past years, some entrants have not
    adequately considered the control network and algorithms needed for
    autonomous drilling. They have often misunderstood the need for
    calibrated sensors and fast, accurate data handling. Some teams did
    not consider measurement errors. Teams from both Group A and B
    ignored uncertainty principles. All of this and more is needed to
    build and operate a complete automated drilling system. We encourage
    all teams to start out with a simple concept done well, and then
    build on it from year to year adding complexity when warranted.
    Planning for this evolution will make it easier on future team
    members.

2. The students should produce novel ideas leading to new drilling
    models, improved drilling machines and sensors, and the ability to
    integrate the data, models and machines that will hopefully create
    new, more efficient ways to drill wells in the future. Any such
    innovation will belong to the students and their university in
    accordance with the university’s written policies. DSATS and SPE
    waive any claims to students’ intellectual property.

3. The students, working as a multi-disciplinary team, will gain
    hands-on experience that will be directly applicable to a career in
    the upstream drilling industry.

### Background

1. What is DSATS?

DSATS is a technical section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)
organized to promote the adoption of automation techniques using surface
and downhole machines and instrumentation to improve the safety and
efficiency of the drilling process. More information is available at
[https://www.spe-dsats.org/](https://www.spe-dsats.org/).

2. Why an international competition?

DSATS and the other technical sections, as part of the SPE, are a group
of volunteers from many nations, connected by their belief that drilling
automation will have a long-term, positive influence on the drilling
industry. This diversity helped to shape the direction of the
organization. The group feels that the industry needs to attract young
professionals from all cultures and disciplines to advance drilling
practices in all areas of the world. The winners of the competition will
receive a grant for economy class transportation and accommodations to
attend the next SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and will present an SPE
paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro[^1]. Note that
this year, the Drillbotics Committee will submit both Group A and Group
B winning abstracts to the conference program committee. They will
choose which of the two abstracts best fit their program. The
Drillbotics committee will help the winning team from the other Group
receive recognition of their achievement and have the opportunity via a
different conference[^2] to publish an SPE paper that will be added to
the SPE archives of One Petro. DSATS believes recognition at one of the
industry’s leading technical conferences will demonstrate to industry
leaders the extent of research and understanding the student teams have
gained during the contest. Also, the practical experience with drilling
automation systems increases the students’ visibility to the companies
that are leading automation activities.

3. Why include a safety case

Safety of personnel, equipment and the environment are always critical
for any drilling operation. The industry begins any project or operation
with safety in mind, and a safety case is a proven method of identifying
and mitigating risks. This is no different on a small scale or for a
virtual operation. Safety goes far beyond personal protective equipment.
Where can someone be hurt – in a lab with heavy rock samples and
rotating machinery? Electrocution? High pressure leaks? Traveling to and
from locations? Judges want to see how teams plan ahead in their first
few meetings to identify threats and develop processes or devices to
reduce the risk and severity of any incidents.

4. Why include Human Factors?

Any complex engineered system that is wholly reliant upon human
operators to achieve its goal is likely to experience issues. Humans are
inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make
wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are
prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as
the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example)
such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues
associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain
tasks to automation. Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and
ensuring that your ‘projected’ drilling operator remains ‘in the loop’
through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will
face in the Drillbotics competition. It is imperative that teams show
how they implemented human factors in their processes and interfaces,
both in the creation of their rig or model and how the operators/judges
will use their designs.

Students working with automated systems should learn about the risks and
proper strategies to allow humans and machines to work together safely
and efficiently. Reference documents are listed in Appendix B.
Requirements for human factors provisions are shown in Appendix A.

5. Items posted on the website are part of these Guidelines

The Drillbotics website at
[www.Drillbotics.com](https://drillbotics.com/) includes
official updates to the competition guidelines and schedule, as well as
FAQs, photos, and previous entrants’ submittals and reports and numerous
reference documents. **Any updates to the guidelines posted on the
Drillbotics website via FAQs or blog entries from the Committee are
considered to be an official revision to these Guidelines.**

6. Questions should be directed to the competition email at
    [competition@drillbotics.com](mailto:competition@drillbotics.com).
    Teams must provide the reference number of the section of the
    guidelines when you ask questions. Questions and answers will be
    incorporated into the FAQs periodically.

### General Competition Guidelines

1. Entrants to Group A challenge have the option to sign up to do a
    well control challenge. They will need to use OpenLab Drilling
    simulator (<https://openlab.app/> ) with the D-WIS interface.

2. Teams also have the option to work on a 2D or optional 3D steering
    challenge. They will develop a drilling system model that represents
    a full-scale system and corresponding control scheme to virtually
    drill a directional well to a given trajectory as efficiently as
    possible within constraints of safety and economics.

3. The Group A challenge does not involve building a rig or drilling
    system. The teams will design automation and control modules to
    develop a virtual drilling system (i.e., computer models) to test
    and demonstrate the controls. Teams that develop modules that can
    updated in future years find that their code is stronger than a
    complete re-write.

4. The Group B challenge requires the design, construction, and
    operation of a physical mini-rig to physically drill a directional
    well to a given trajectory as efficiently as possible within
    constraints of safety and economics. Teams may work on a 2D or
    optional 3D steering challenge. The guidelines for Group B are
    published separately.

5. The contest covers only the drilling of one hole section. There is
    no need to run casing. There is no need for automated pipe handling
    at the surface. There is no logging or cementing. This is just a
    drilling problem. However, teams should consider sampling and
    surveying and dealing with uncertainty.

6. Judges want to see evidence that teams know about drilling and
    modeling aspects of well construction. Because teams will either
    build or model a physical rig and downhole conditions, they must
    specify the assumptions made about their project. Allowing
    judges to understand “why” you made certain choices affecting the
    evaluation of your project.

7. While the teams will have to meet minimum competition requirements,
    any exceptional contributions “above and beyond” the main theme will
    be rewarded with additional points to encourage creativity and
    innovation.

8. Teams are free to choose the hardware and software most suited to
    their design except where explicitly specified. Teams are free to
    choose any software language. Judges would like to see an
    explanation of the reason certain hardware or software was selected.

9. Teams are encouraged to review the design reports, presentations,
    and test recordings available on the website, since these include
    designs that worked or didn’t work and students thoughts about their
    earlier choices.

### Team Members

1. DSATS envisions that the students would be at least at the senior
    undergraduate or Masters level, well versed in the disciplines
    needed for such a project. The core team shall consist of at
    least three (3) team members and no more than five (5).
    Contributions from other team members is allowed, and all
    contributors should be recognized in the Phase I Design Report. The
    travel grant for the winning team will be limited to five (5) team
    members and one (1) supervisor due to budget constraints.

2. Any team that loses team members during the project can recruit a
    replacement. Note any changes to the team membership or the faculty
    advisor in the monthly reports. Include the email address of the new
    member(s). At least one member of the core team must be a Petroleum
    Engineering candidate with sufficient coursework completed to
    understand the physics relating to the drilling problems and the
    normal industry practices used to mitigate the problem. For
    universities that do not have a petroleum engineering program, two
    schools may join efforts to compete as a single entity (see 5.6)

3. Students with a background in mining, applied mathematics,
    mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as controls,
    mechatronics and automation or software development, are the most
    likely candidates, but students with any applicable background is
    encouraged.

4. A multi-disciplinary team simulates the working environment in the
    drilling industry today, as most products and services are produced
    with the cooperation of technical personnel from differing
    backgrounds and cultures.

5. A university may enter more than one team in a group and may enter
    teams in one or both groups.

6. A collaboration between not more than two universities is allowed,
    especially where one school may not offer a curriculum in a specific
    technical area needed to successfully conduct the project. The
    resulting team may only submit one Phase I design report. Also, the
    travel grant will still be limited to five (5) students and one (1)
    supervisor. Note: Any differences with intellectual property
    ownership between the two schools must be settled by the teams and
    shall not involve DSATS.

7. Students shall register their team not later than 15 October using
    the registration form on the Drillbotics website
    <https://drillbotics.com/guidelines/>. Please indicate the challenge
    (Well Control or 2D or 3D Steering) that the team will be
    participating in.

### Safety

1. The team’s safety plan should consider all foreseeable hazards and
    methods to mitigate them. Personal protective equipment is part of a
    safety plan but is far from sufficient. Teams must consider risks
    due to handling the rock, rotating machinery, electrical shock and
    others. What health considerations are in place? How the team
    communicates with each other before and during operations is also
    important. Judges will grade each team on its comprehensive safety
    plan. This applies to both Group A and Group B.

2. Because most of the Group B rigs have equipment spinning at high
    RPMs, some form of protective cover must be included in the
    team’s rig design. A broken coupling, a loose screw or similar item
    becomes a projectile that can lead to serious injury to the team
    members, judges or visitors. Judges may decide to deny a team from
    competing if their design is unsafe. Similarly, Group A teams may be
    excluded if they have not met proper health and safety
    considerations.

3. The following links are a good starting point, but is by no means a
    comprehensive list of links:

    1. OSHA Pocket Guide, Worker Safety Series:
        [https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html)

        [http://www.scosha.llronline.com/pdfs/genind.pdf](http://www.scosha.llronline.com/pdfs/genind.pdf)

### Expenditures

1. Teams selected to advance to the second phase must limit the cost of
    the physical or virtual rig and materials to US\$ 10,000 per year or
    its equivalent in other currencies. Students may use previous work
    and make changes within the US\$10,000 annual limit. The cost of
    transporting the rig to any local test sites is excluded. Student
    and supervisor travel is excluded. The students shall find a source
    of funding and report the source in the Phase I proposal. All
    funding and procurement should comply with university policy. These
    funds are intended to cover the majority of expenses for hardware,
    software and labor to construct and operate the team’s equipment.
    Teams will not be reimbursed for travel to any local competitions.
    DSATS shall not be liable for any expenditure other than DSATS
    provided material and specified travel expenses.

2. DSATS will assist, when possible, to obtain free PLCs or similar
    control devices and software tools from suppliers affiliated with
    the DSATS organization. Such “in-kind” donations shall not be
    included in the team’s project costs.

3. Students and universities may use other “in-kind” contributions
    which will not be included in the team’s project costs. Such
    contributions may include modeling software, laboratory equipment
    and supplies, and similar paraphernalia usually associated with
    university laboratory projects.

4. Any team spending more than US\$ 10,000, or its equivalent in other
    currencies, may be penalized for running over budget.

5. DSATS reserves the right to audit the team’s and university’s
    expenditures on this project.

6. Any devices built for the project will become the property of the
    university and can be used in future research and competitions. Any
    maintenance or operating costs incurred after the competition will
    not be paid by DSATS.

### Other Considerations

1. University coursework and credit: Each university will decide
    whether or not this project qualifies as a credit(s) towards any
    degree program.

2. The design concepts shall be developed by the student team under the
    supervision of the faculty. Faculty and lab assistants should review
    the designs to ensure student safety.

3. Construction of any equipment shall be supervised by the student
    team but may use skilled labor such as welders and lab technicians.
    The use of outside assistance shall be discussed in the reports and
    the final paper. DSATS encourages the students to gain hands-on
    experience with the construction of the rig since this experience
    will be helpful to the career of individuals in the drilling
    industry.

4. Teams building a virtual rig may create new models or improve models
    from other teams at the same university or elsewhere. Be aware of
    open source models from groups such as the Open Source Drilling
    Community (<https://opensourcedrilling.org/>). Teams must cite the
    original work done by others. Teams are also encouraged to share
    their models with the OSDC.

#### Other items of interest

To teach students that their work involves economic trade-offs, the
monthly report should include the economic basis of decisions for
hardware or software. It should also include at a minimum a summary
estimate of team member labor hours for each step in the project:
modeling, controls, testing etc. and a cost summary for hardware and
software related expenditures. Also include labor for non-students that
affect the cost of the project. Labor rates are not considered, as to
eliminate international currency effects. Labor is not considered in the
cost limits of section 7.1 but should be discussed in the reports.

#### Phase I Design Report

Detailed requirements for each group are listed in their respective
Appendix A.

#### Final report, presentation and paper

1. The finalists shall prepare a project report that addresses items
    specific to each Group. We suggest you use the format of most SPE
    papers. For reference, please see <http://spe.org/authors/resources/>.
    This report may be submitted up to four weeks after the final test.

2. Finalists shall prepare a pre-recorded presentation two weeks prior
    to the Phase II test. Judges will review the recording and prepare a
    list of questions for the Q&A session that precedes the final test.
    Numerous examples are available online at

    <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRTpKWHRiphNo6KeSqTcNyg>

3. The reports, presentations, paper and all communications with DSATS
    shall be in the English language. The presentation must be made by
    at least one member of the student team, not the team supervisor.

### Group A and Group B Prizes

1. The program committee of the Drilling Conference awarded the
    Drillbotics subcommittee a permanent slot[^3] in one of the drilling
    sessions at the conference. As per SPE’s customary procedures, the
    paper will be archived in OnePetro. In addition, SPE has agreed to
    furnish a booth[^4] in the exhibition area during the conference
    where the team can erect their rig and describe its operation to the
    conference attendees. Alternately, Group A teams will have an
    opportunity to showcase their simulation model at the booth.

2. This is an excellent opportunity for students to network with the
    industry.

3. The winning team, as determined by the conference program committee,
    will be asked to submit a paper to present at the next SPE/IADC
    Drilling Conference.

4. The Drilling Conference program committee will choose either a Group
    A or Group B winner to present at the conference. Only at their
    discretion will the second group receive an invitation to present.
    The Drillbotics Committee may fund both teams travel if it holds
    sufficient funds, which will be determined a month before the Phase
    II test.

5. The winning team will receive a travel grant[^5] to attend the
    Drilling Conference. Note that this is for a limited number of team
    members, not to exceed five (5) plus one (1) supervisor.
    Pre-approval of expenses is required.

    1. Upon submittal to DSATS of a valid expense statement of covered
        expenses (typically a spreadsheet supported by written receipts)
        individuals will be reimbursed by the treasurer of DSATS for the
        following:

    2. Round trip economy airfare for the team and one university
        sponsor/supervisor to the gateway city of the next SPE/IADC
        Drilling Conference. Entrants should use the SPE approved
        carrier where possible to minimize cost. Airfares that exceed
        the SPE rate must be pre-approved by the committee, or the
        reimbursement will be limited to the SPE rate. Information of
        reduced fare flights is available on the conference website.
        Please note that reservations must be made before the SPE
        published deadline. The departure point will be a city near the
        university, the student’s home, or current place of work,
        subject to review by the Committee. Alternately, a mileage
        reimbursement will be made in lieu of airfare should the
        entrants decide to drive rather than fly to the conference. The
        reimbursement is based on current allowable mileage rates
        authorized by the US Internal Revenue Service.

    3. One rental car/van at the gateway city for those teams that fly
        to the conference.

    4. Lodging related to one hotel room or housing unit[^6] per team
        member will be reimbursed at a rate not to exceed the SPE rate.
        Note that the room reservations are limited, so entrants must
        book their rooms early. Room and taxes for the night before the
        DSATS symposium, the night of the symposium and for the nights
        of the conference are covered. Charges for the room on the last
        day of the conference need to be pre-approved by the Committee
        as most conference attendees depart on the last day of the
        conference unless there are unusual circumstances.

    5. A per diem will be pre-approved by the Committee each year,
        which will vary with the cost of living in the gateway city. The
        per diem is intended to cover average meals (breakfast, lunch
        and dinner) and incidentals.

    6. Conference registration will be reimbursed. Students should
        register for the conference at the student rate. Early
        registration is appreciated.

6. Individual award certificates will be presented to all participants
    upon request, with special certificates given to all finalists. Team
    members wanting a certificate should send an email to
    [competition@Drillbotics.com](mailto:competition@drillbotics.com) with the spelling of their name as they
    wish it to appear on the certificate.

7. DSATS may provide additional awards, at its sole discretion.

8. The evaluation and all decisions on any matter in the competition by
    the Drillbotics judges and DSATS board are final.

## Appendix A: Group A Project Definition

### Phase I – Design Competition

1. Prepare a safety plan at the beginning of the project and update it
    continually as needed.

2. Consider how you will use Human Factors within your project to
    improve your team processes and interactions with your model. You
    should include such items as:

    1. Who are the operators of your drilling rig and how do their
        characteristics impact the design?

    2. Which functions of your drilling rig will be automated, and
        which will be manual (refer to Ref. 2)?

    3. How are you going to ensure that the operator remains 'in the
        loop' at all times?

    4. The workflow that your drilling rig will follow (very important
        as this will guide your interface design).

    5. The control and feedback needs for your defined operators.

    6. The 'concept' of your interface design. This can be as simple as
        a 'wireframe' drawing with pen and paper, but it should show an
        appreciation of Human Factors Relevant Good Practice (refer to
        the resources provided below).

4. 3D Steering Challenge:

    1. Determine the level of complexity you want for your model.
        Previous teams started with a plan to incorporate many complex
        features within their model but were unable to deliver a working
        system in time for the Phase II test. The committee suggests you
        start out with an overall plan that allows you to first create a
        working model and later add modules to increase its
        functionality and fidelity. Explain your choices.

    2. Develop a model of the rig’s equipment, drillstring, BHA and bit
        and model a directional well drilled through multiple targets.
        Teams may choose a two-dimensional well path or opt for a
        three-dimensional trajectory. Three targets will be provided
        just before the Phase II test with the third target in a
        different plane that requires a turn as well as a drop. There
        could even be a build to reach a shallower depth.

    3. The interface should use the vocabulary of the D-WIS semantics
        standard. Please refer to <https://d-wis.org/vocabulary-index/>.

    4. See Section B below for additional information.

5. Well Control Challenge:

    1. Review the OpenLab Drilling simulator
        (https://openlab.app/) application. This will be the
        simulator we will use for the well control challenge.

    2. The interface should use the vocabulary of the D-WIS semantics
        standard. Please refer to <https://d-wis.org/vocabulary-index/>.

    3. Teams will develop appropriate controls to detect and react to a
        well control issue (e.g. a kick).

    4. Test cases will be provided to the teams to test their control
        algorithm prior to the Phase II test.

    5. Teams will have to develop a user interface allowing the judges
        to monitor the drilling state.

    6. See Section C below for additional information.

16. Phase I Design Report

The design submittal by the students shall include:

2. Student Biographies

4. Name

5. Previous degree attained – major

6. Current degree and expected graduation date (month/year)

7. Main area of contribution to the project

8. Other information as deemed appropriate by the team

9. A description of your safety plan that is appropriate for the
    project

10. Your process for including human factors in the design and
    implementation of the model.

11. Simplified engineering sketches or drawings of the rig concept,
    mechanical and electrical and auxiliary systems, if any, that
    explain your design assumptions. Teams should recognize that they
    should model the rig capabilities with realistic limits for surface
    equipment and downhole tools. Consideration of time delays and
    measurement errors that mimic realistic rig systems increase the
    fidelity of your model.

13. Where applicable, include any design notes and calculations
    regarding the rig, drillstring and other limitations for the
    particular modules used in your models. For example, if the model
    has a module to adjust drilling parameters to avoid buckling of the
    drillstring, show how you calculated the weight on bit limits.

14. A block diagram/flowchart of the modeled control system architecture
    is required. Describe the key features. The response time of
    measurements, data aggregation and control algorithms should be
    estimated. Explain how individual measurements are used in the
    control code. Are they all given equal weight, and if not, what
    criteria is used to assign importance?

15.

16. Proposed user interface/data display that shows the progress of the
    model in real time.

17. Cost estimate and funding plan

18.

19.

20. A design summary video used to outline the design submittal not to
    exceed five (5) minutes in length. Videos shall be the property of
    the university, but DSATS shall have the right to use the videos on
    its websites and in its meetings or events.

21. Key features for any models and control software. What drilling
    dysfunctions are modeled and how are they mitigated?

22. If you are modeling sensors, explain how specific sensors and sensor
    data is modeled. What did you learn from modeling sensors?

23. Proposed model for data handling, i.e., inherent time delays and
    uncertainty.

<!-- -->

1. The speed or rate of time of the model versus the simulated drilling
    time. Is this continuous or can certain intervals be slowed as
    needed?

2. The Phase I design report should include a discussion regarding the
    major design concept as modeled (mechanical and otherwise) with
    respect to the feasibility for use on today’s working rigs? If not,
    what would be needed to allow implementation?

<!-- -->

17. Phase I Evaluation

    1. The judges will review the design reports and rank teams using
        the same criteria as the Phase II evaluation information below.

    2. The results will be announced in mid-February with comments that
        teams may want to incorporate into their Phase II efforts.

    17. The committee will advance as many teams as is economically
        possible as finalists for Phase II.

### 3D Steering Challenge Design Criteria

#### Overview

Teams will create a digital twin of a full-scale rig of their choice to
drill a directional well virtually. The Drillbotics committee will
provide certain information in advance but will not provide the actual
well targets until the day of the Phase II test. The following attached
pages describe the directional objectives as well as the
data/deliverables requirements. Scoring for the directional competition
objective will be primarily based on how accurately the directional
targets are intersected by the calculated well trajectory. An example of
the criteria for scoring is included below.

The end goal is for teams to develop a virtual drilling model and a
control model to drill a well  
virtually. The details in the sections below are some recommendations on
what you will have to consider when building the virtual drilling model.
You and your team will have to determine what physics of the drilling
process you want to model. But keep in mind that the competition
challenge is to drill a directional well virtually to specified targets.

1. Teams should list key rig equipment used in their model and describe
    any specific equipment limitations. For example, if the team uses a
    top drive for torque and rotation, indicate what model top drive is
    modeled. Consider items such as maximum torque at a specific RPM.
    Teams should understand if their model requests torque or speed in
    excess of the equipment limits it negatively affects the fidelity of
    their model.

2. The rig model will typically consist of a hoist, usually a drawworks
    with drill line on a drum, a top drive providing the torque and RPM.
    The RPM, Torque, and Hookload are measurements taken at the rig
    model and will be inputs into the Control System.

3. The downhole drilling system model should predict bit trajectory for
    given WOB, RPM, drive mechanism parameters (e.g. steering force, AKO
    angle), and rock strength – as a function of measured depth. While
    the teams are empowered to decide on the complexity of the
    simulation model, the minimum requirements are stated below.

4. Another consideration is the delays inherent in taking surveys. If
    your model assumes continuous surveys only available with high-speed
    telemetry systems, that should be stated in your list of
    assumptions. If you assume that the survey is coming from a MWD or
    RSS tool, use frequencies and intervals that are more realistic to
    those systems.

5. Consider the impact of survey errors and cumulative errors for your
    model to make it more realistic.

6. Determine the appropriate update rates for each cycle within your
    model. Depending on how simple or complex your design your system,
    this may be one rate for the entire model or you may have some
    modules running at a different rate. If so, explain how you manage
    the synchronization of time across various modules.

    1. Teams may choose to iterate based on time or depth, but they
        must ensure that survey course lengths are appropriate for the
        dogleg severities being surveyed. It’s typically recommended to
        not have survey intervals exceed 10m-13m (30ft – 50ft) in length
        for accurate wellbore placement. This should be considered in
        the control scheme if time-based survey intervals are being
        used.

    2. If you include modules to introduce drilling dysfunction and
        mitigation techniques, you may increase the functionality of
        your overall model but risk not meeting the project timeline or
        ending up with stability issues with you model. Explain how you
        chose which items to include or exclude.

    3. If you do choose to simulate full-scale rig effects, explain
        what frequencies you selected appropriate for the dynamics of
        the drilling system both at surface and downhole. Or you may
        have chosen a simpler design just for lab use. Discussion of
        such choices should be included in the design report.

    4. If you choose to include alerts for equipment or drilling
        dysfunctions, consider a plan for managing alerts that inform
        the observer without overwhelming them with too many alerts.
        Consider some of the references in Appendix C.

    5. Additional optional items for the directional drilling option:

        1. If you choose a course that does not intersect with a
            target, but lies within an acceptable proximity to the
            target, explain your choice.

        2. Since this is a directional drilling problem, be sure to
            include how simulated downhole data is used for steering and
            other drilling aspects? Judges are looking for a description
            of the principles being applied to directionally steer the
            wellbore and hit the required targets.

#### Objectives

1. Hit one or more targets at one or more vertical depth(s) and X/Y
    coordinates.

2. For the Group B competition, the starting directional plan to hit
    the targets will not require wellbore inclinations in excess of 30°
    from vertical, 15° change in azimuth, or 10” displacement (departure
    from the vertical axis at well center) The max
    displacement/inclination/azimuth are total/accumulated from the
    start to the end of the well path.

3. Please note: Teams should be prepared to drill any given trajectory
    within the specified parameters, so the coordinates will not be
    provided in advance of the test.

#### Automation Requirements

> Drilling mode/survey mode switching must be automated (i.e. built-in
> survey interval and drill string movement for on/off-bottom,
> slide/rotation mode switching). Teams may select how many surveys,
> survey frequency, and whether surveys will be made on or off bottom.
> Displays should show when surveys are being taken.

#### Steering

1. Steering requirements (e.g. toolface direction, slide length) must
    be calculated autonomously

2. The steering model takes inputs from the Bit Model and BHA Model to
    predict trajectory. A control system will also interface with the
    Steering Model and update parameters (such as pad force, AKO
    orientation, WOB, RPM, etc) accordingly.

3. Orientation of steering mechanism must be calculated by the system
    and shown on the rig floor display.

4. An RSS or AKO motor BHA will be specified on the day of the Phase II
    test. Thus, the model should be capable of simulating both steering
    systems.

#### Surveys

1. Directional surveying process must be entirely autonomous

2. Survey qualification must be done autonomously, however secondary
    qualification/verification/override can be made by a human

3. Dogleg severity required to hit target(s), distance/direction to
    plan must be autonomously calculated at each survey station and
    shown on the rig floor display

#### Deliverables Requirements (Magnetic surveying)

1. All teams are required to provide a definitive directional survey
    (TXT, LAS, or CSV format) meeting the following minimum
    requirements:

2. Header info to include:

    1. Team/school name

    2. Directional Survey Date

    3. Well Center Coordinates (WGS84 Latitude & Longitude)

    4. True Vertical Depth Reference (in depth units above block level)

    5. Grid Convergence

    6. Geomagnetic model used (if applicable)

    7. Magnetic declination applied (Geomagnetic model or in-field
        referenced)

    8. Total Azimuth Correction

    9. Magnetic field dip reference (Geomagnetic model or in-field
        referenced)

    10. Total magnetic field strength reference (Geomagnetic model or
        in-field referenced)

    11. Error model associated with well trajectory (ISCWSA/OWSG error
        model or otherwise)

        1. If non-standard error model is being used (i.e., formulas
            being modified and/or coefficients being changed), error
            model description (using standard variable/coefficient
            naming conventions) and justification must be included in
            project design

3. Minimum Curvature calculated trajectory (using appropriate survey
    station interval to accurately represent the drilled wellbore
    position)

<!-- -->

1. Each survey station is to include the following data:

    1. Measured Depth

    2. Inclination

    3. Azimuth (referenced to “block north”)

    4. True Vertical Depth

    5. Northing (from well center)

    6. Easting (from well center)

    7. Dogleg Severity

2. Final survey station is to be an extrapolation to total depth at the
    bit

#### Plots

1. All teams are required to provide plan vs. actual plots containing
    the following minimum requirements:

2. As-drilled trajectory and original planned trajectory shown on same
    TVD vs.

3. Vertical Section plot

<!-- -->

1. Vertical section direction to be determined by well center-to-target
    bearing

2. As-drilled trajectory and original planned trajectory shown on same
    X/Y plot

3. Grid north reference to “block north”

4. \[0,0\] at well center

#### Data Logs

1. All teams are required to provide directional survey raw data logs
    containing the following minimum requirements:

2. Each log entry is to include the following data:

    1. Time stamp (containing year, month, date, hour, minute, second)

    2. Sensor measured depth

    3. Downhole sensor value(s) recorded

        - Sensor axes values

        - Calculated survey qualifier values

    4. Accepted survey indicator (if log entry is an intended survey
        station)

        - If secondary (i.e., human) qualification is also used, both
          acceptance indicators must be shown

#### Formation Characteristics

1. DSATS will furnish a formation model immediately prior to the Phase
    II test.

2. Teams should prepare in advance to import or manually enter the
    data, as they prefer.

3. The formation model should be defined by rock type, UCS, and
    confining pressure. At each simulation step increment, the bit
    drills and extends the wellbore. While calculation of explicit
    contact forces with the wellbore are not mandatory, the build rate
    will still change due to newly formed wellbore geometry and changing
    rock strength. This phenomenon must be taken into effect accurately.
    Teams can assume a 2D wellbore and thus develop a 2D drilling
    propagation model. The format for the formation data will be
    provided in late November.

#### Targets

> The targets will not be available until immediately prior to the Phase
> II test. However, the starting directional plan to hit the targets
> will not require wellbore inclinations in excess of 30° from vertical,
> 15° change in azimuth. Note: This is a maximum. Be prepared for much
> smaller build rates.

#### Trajectory

> Teams shall choose their own trajectory to optimize the drilling, the
> well path and closeness to the given targets. This should be computed
> autonomously after the targets are manually entered. Limit the scope
> to 2-D for both the steering model as well as the formation model
>
> for BHA/bit deflection behavior.

#### Bit Model

1. The bit model can be as simple as the equivalent model of Pessier et
    al. (1992) with appropriate framework for steerability such as bit
    anisotropy and bit tilt such as Menand et al. (2012). Effect of key
    parameters such as gauge length, drilling efficiency (MSE-DOC
    relationship) should be included. Inclusion of bit wear effects is
    not mandatory. For the purposes of this challenge, the bit model
    provided is sufficient. If teams wish to use a different bit, the
    directional bit behavior modeling assumptions should be clearly
    stated. The implementation (or sub-models) should be verified
    against published data such as Menand et al. (2012).

2. DSATS has provided the following bit model for the Phase II test.

    1. Input:

        1. Formation Aggressiveness (provided by Contest),

        2. Bit Aggressiveness Factor between 0.7 and 1.3 (Contestants
            will select a bit with this value, which remains constant
            through the run.),

        3. Weight-on-Bit,

        4. Bit RPM,

        5. Drilling Efficiency (provided by contest, “Eff” = 0.35),

        6. Bit Diameter (“D”) (provided by Contest),

        7. Formation confined compressive strength (“CCS”) (provided by
            Contest according to a formation model/prognosis),

        8. Side cutting factor (provided by Contest, a constant value
            associated with a particular bit. Different bits are more
            laterally aggressive than  
            others. Teams will either be assigned a bit with a
            particular Side cutting factor, or be forced to choose among
            bits with different side cutting factors.), Side force
            (provided by the Team’s drillstring model)

    2. Output:

        1. Axial Rate of Penetration

        2. Lateral Rate of Penetration

        3. Bit Torque

        4. mu = formation_aggressivenss\*bit_aggressiveness_factor;

        5. ROP = (13.33\*RPM.\*mu.\*WOB)\*(Eff)/(D\*CCS); % \[ft/hr\];
            Derived from Teale MSE concept (1965).

        6. TOB = D\*(mu.\*WOB)./36; % \[ft-lbs\]; Derived from Pessier
            and Fear, SPE 24584 (1992)

        7. ROP lateral = side_cutting_factor\*side_force\*RPM/(D\*CCS);

4. If teams wish to provide their own bit model, please explain why
    they want a separate bit model and please provide the code at least
    three (3) weeks prior to the Phase II test.

#### Drillstring

1. Teams should specify the physical characteristics of the drillstring
    used in their analysis.

2. The Drillstring may be represented by one or more models. These
    models will have to do the following:

3. Calculate torque and drag for a 2D or 3D survey, with hook load, mud
    weight, drill string/BHA dimensions, sheave friction and variable
    friction factors along the wellbore as inputs. Using this data, the
    model will be able to predict downhole WOB and available torque at
    the bit, which will be used as input to the Bit Models.

4. The Drillstring Model(s) must also calculate buckling conditions.
    Drilling ahead in simulation will not be allowed if the Drillstring
    is buckling at any point along the Drillstring.

5. The Drillstring Model(s) must be able to simulate torsional
    oscillations (slow ones, like stick slip). It must be made up of
    multiple torsional spring elements and have friction damping from
    wellbore contact. Bit behavior in different rocks and at different
    WOB/RPM settings will cause stick slip, and the Control System for
    the top drive must be able to counteract stick slip automatically
    when it appears.

6. Please do not attempt to model lateral vibrations of the Drillstring
    or BHA.

7. The BHA must be modeled so that contact force at the bit and bit
    tilt are computed to be used in the steering model. Generally
    speaking, 100 ft. of the BHA within the wellbore needs to be modeled
    in order for correct bit side force and bit tilt computations. The
    resulting behavior of drive mechanism should be modeled. The BHA
    should also (virtually) measure certain parameters (such as
    inclination, RPM, vibration etc.) and return to the surface or the
    control system. The bit-to-sensor distance as well as measurement
    frequency (i.e., intermittent vs continuous survey) should be
    configurable parameters in the design.

8. Teams are not required, but may consider whether their model assumes
    that the pipe will be subject to the same radius of curvature as the
    well trajectory. Consideration should include drill pipe,
    connections and BHA (versus one continuous section of drill pipe).
    What are the external bending moments and forces? How will this
    affect stress/strain? The pipe clearance from the wellbore wall may
    allow it to have a less severe bend and the connection points would
    also influence the stress/strain of the pipe body. Another question
    is whether plastic deformation should be allowed?

### Well Control Criteria

#### Overview

Teams will use the OpenLab Drilling simulator
(https://openlab.app/) as the model for the drilling process and
develop appropriate controls to detect and control a well control issue.

1. We will package in a Docker container an OPC UA server with the
    D-WIS connectivity from which the students can connect to the
    OpenLab Drilling simulator.

2. Each team will run the Docker image on their computer.

3. Their program can access the local OPC-UA following the D-WIS
    interface and they can send set-points to the simulator and receive
    measurements from the virtual sensors on the simulator.

4. The Docker image will make it possible to access a few different
    test cases.

5. The day of the competition, we will change the access to the
    simulator on one of the accessible test cases where we will have
    prepared a different drilling configuration.

6. The trajectory, wellbore geometry, geo-pressure margins, drilling
    fluid characteristics, drill-string, available sensors at the rig
    will all be different for each of the available training cases and
    will be again different during the day of the competition. So the
    controls software shall rely on the D-WIS interface to discover
    which signals are available for each of the cases.

7. The cases are centered around experiencing a kick during connection
    in water-based mud, i.e., analysis of the flow-back pattern when the
    mud pumps are turned off (and on). This is a typical scenario for a
    well control event for which the simulator will provide realistic
    responses. However, the responses are very different depending on
    the rig configuration, the length of the well, the compressibility
    and temperature of the mud, etc.

So, to summarize, the team’s work will be to control the drilling
machines (top-drive, hoisting, mud-pumps) to start drilling a stand,
drill the stand and then start the connection procedure. The internal
geopressured margins will be different from what the case describes and
depending on how they have drilled the stand, they will get (or not) a
kick with relatively variable appearance.

#### General guidelines for both challenges (Well Control and 3D Steering)

#### Automated Drilling

1. After initiating the model it should run until completion without
    human involvement. Remote operation and/or intervention is not
    allowed.

2. Teams may choose the level of complexity for their model. The
    following is only one example of a typical control system that may
    include the following elements:

    1. Drilling Optimization: Optimize set point commands for
        drilling parameters such as WOB, RPM, etc. such that drilling
        performance and steering are optimized (according to each team’s
        definition of “optimized performance”). Such real-time
        optimization should be done automatically.

    2. Trajectory Control: For the 3D Steering Challenge, steer
        the well according to the given well plan. The objective is both
        to minimize trajectory error and wellbore tortuosity. Virtual
        surveys should be acquired and be used as feedback for the
        steering control logic. Be prepared to model a push-the-bit RSS
        and a bent motor AKO. The steering model should include
        considerations for how often the survey is taken and how far
        from the bit the sensors are placed (e.g., projecting from the
        survey depth to the bit, and the control system using survey
        information to decide steering parameters).

    3. Rig Display: Real-time display of the drilling parameters
        and wellbore positioning during the final testing is mandatory.
        End of well report immediately after the competition is
        mandatory.

    4. Set Point Control: Although set point control, i.e.,
        automatic control of drilling parameters as per optimal set
        points, is an integral element of the drilling systems, this
        competition does not make it mandatory to reduce complexity. It
        can be assumed that the surface parameters such as WOB and RPM
        reach the BHA, making quasi-static modeling sufficient. However,
        the teams are encouraged to go “above and beyond” and
        demonstrate set point control independent of trajectory
        drilling. For example, the WOB and RPM control could be
        implemented for the virtual drill rig with a suitable mechanism
        for applying WOB (e.g., dead weight and drawworks), RPM (e.g.,
        top drive), etc. Characteristics for each sub-system could be
        assumed realistically (e.g., top drive motor characteristics
        with RPM-torque relationship). Other examples include
        slide/rotate mode control.

#### Coding

1. The entire code should be written with a modular design with
    functions/subroutines for each sub-system. The drilling system model
    should be a separate application that interacts with the control
    system. Appropriate interfaces (APIs) should be developed for
    interoperability and deployment.

2. Note that code for some modules is available on the
    [website](https://opensourcedrilling.org/) of the Open Source
    Drilling Community. Go to their [GitHub page](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community) for the
    models. If teams use any of these models, please be sure to cite the
    source and give a brief explanation of how the model works and why
    you chose it. Also consider joining the community and eventually
    sharing your contributions.

3. Teams are encouraged to share their code to promote the learning
    spirit. Such sharing can occur during or after the final
    presentations, or after securing any IP protection, at the
    discretion of the teams. However, release of codes is not mandatory
    and will not count towards the final score.

#### Data visualization

1. Teams must provide a display to observe the status of the model.

2. Novel ways of presenting the data and progress of drilling in real
    time will receive particular attention from the judges.

3. Visualization of any processes (automation, optimization, drilling
    state, etc.) should be intuitive and easily understood by the
    judges, who will view this from the perspective of the driller
    operating a rig equipped with automated controls.

4. All depths shall use the industry-standard datum of rotary/kelly
    bushing interface (RKB), which should be the top of the rig’s “drill
    floor.”

#### Phase I design Report

1. Teams will submit a detailed report containing detailed literature
    review, model assumptions, overall plan of the virtual system,
    including the system architecture, different layers (such as data
    layer, control layer etc.), mathematical framework for modeling and
    control schemes, a plan for implementation, and relevant details. It
    is preferable to include a special section for the API, if other
    systems need to interact with your system. Preliminary results from
    the virtual drilling rig model should be included, along with a
    discussion on the results.

2. There are numerous examples of previous reports on the Drillbotics
    website. Feel free to use this as a resource. Should a team choose
    to use the concepts in previous reports in their design, be sure to
    cite the source of the information to avoid plagiarism concerns.

### Phase II – Drilling Competition

1. Phase II Activities

    1. Teams will continue to develop and tune their models.

    2. Monthly progress reports are due at the end of each month.

    3. Teams will deliver a pre-recorded presentation for the Phase II
        test two weeks prior to the test:

        1. The students will present a BRIEF summary of their final
            design, highlighting changes from their Phase I design, if
            any. Include an explanation of why any changes were
            necessary, as this indicates to the judges how much students
            learned during the design and construction process. Explain
            what *key* features have been deployed. Describe novel
            developments or things learned that were worthwhile. Also
            include how actual expenses compared with the initial
            estimate. At some time during your talk, let us know who the
            team members are and what background they have that pertains
            to the project. Try to include all your team members as
            presenters, not just one spokesperson. The committee wants
            to see if all team members have a good understanding of key
            issues.

        2. Previous teams used a short PowerPoint presentation of about
            ten slides or so. Use any format you like.

2. Phase II Testing

    1. In the spring term of 2022-2023, qualifying teams will present
        their model to efficiently drill a deviated well to hit the
        required targets while controlling drilling dysfunctions as the
        primary technical objective of the competition.

    2. The contest will begin with streaming of a pre-recorded
        presentation by each team. This will be followed by a period of
        questions and answers (Q&A) via on-line or in-person or a hybrid
        of both. Teams will draw lots to determine the order of
        presentation. All teams may sit in for the presentations and Q&A
        of the other teams.

    3. Depending on the time available, the actual test will start
        shortly after the last presentation of the day. It is possible
        that the presentations and tests could take two days to
        complete.

    4. While sharing of code is not mandatory, the presentations should
        include the details of the control schemes. Organizers can be
        contacted in case of any confidentiality requirements.

    5. The drilling plan will be presented to the teams on the day of
        competition.

    6. The rock properties will be provided as a function of true
        vertical depth or measured depth at that time.

    7. An RSS or AKO motor BHA will be specified on the day of the
        competition. Thus, the model should be capable of simulating
        both steering systems.

    8. Drillbotics may provide data to calibrate sub-models such as the
        bit model. Additional details will be released during Phase II.

    9. **The teams are given a maximum of three hours to virtually
        drill the well**. Students are allowed to debug/modify the code
        and use multiple attempts within the allotted time.

3. Evaluation

    1. Teams will be evaluated on a per model basis. Points will be
        given for having each model or control system present and
        functioning in a realistic manner. A team that predicts the
        trajectory the best but is missing a model of the rig will earn
        fewer points than a team that has all the models and control
        systems from bit to rig. The purpose is to model the entire
        system and have the sub-models behave realistically.

    2. The set point control is not a mandatory item for the
        competition. Any demonstration of such capability will attract
        extra points in “above and beyond” category.

Drilling performance will be observed and measured by Drillbotics judges
invited to attend and witness the test. This could be an in-person or
virtual event depending on travel restrictions. The details will be
announced in April 2022.

### Final Report and Paper

The finalists shall prepare a project report that addresses the items
below. We suggest you use the format of most SPE papers. For reference,
please see
[http://spe.org/authors/resources/](http://spe.org/authors/resources/)

1. The final report is simply an update following the Phase II test to
    explain what worked and what did not and to discuss future plans
    that would improve your design.

2. The winning team in Group A will need to start work on an abstract
    for their paper shortly after the Phase II test results are
    announced.

3. If the abstract is accepted, in August or September, the team needs
    to start writing their SPE paper. The abstract must generate
    sufficient interest with the SPE review committees to warrant
    publication, although DSATS will help promote acceptance elsewhere
    if necessary.

4. The timing for submission of the abstract and paper will be the
    published deadlines per the call for papers and conference
    guidelines as posted on the SPE’s website
([www.spe.org](http://www.spe.org)).

5. The paper should address at a minimum:

    1. The technical considerations for the model of the rig, its
        control system, drillstring including BHA and why certain
        features were chosen and why others were rejected.

    2. The setup of the experimental test, the results and
        shortcomings.

    3. Recommendations for improvements to the design and testing
        procedures.

    4. Recommendations for improvements by DSATS of the competition
        guidelines, scheduling and provided material.

    5. Areas of learning gained through the competition not covered in
        the university course material

    6. Note that the SPE audience already knows a lot of the background
        information that you presented the judges to demonstrate your
        capabilities, so adjust the paper content accordingly.

## Appendix B: Automation & Interface Design from a Human Factors Perspective

**Background on Automation**

Any complex, engineered system that is wholly reliant upon human
operators to achieve its goal is likely to experience issues. Humans are
inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make
wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are
prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as
the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example)
such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues
associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain
tasks to automation.

The concept that 'machines' (read automation) are better at some tasks
than humans and vice versa has been prevalent for decades. The original
incarnation of this notion was presented in 'Fitts List' \[Ref. 1\].
'Fitts List' is 11 statements designed to provide guidance on 'what
humans are best at' compared to 'what machines are best at' for example:

Humans surpass machines in respect to:

- 'Their ability to improvise and use flexible procedures'

Machines surpass humans in respect to:

- 'Their ability to handle highly complex operations i.e., to do many
  different things at once'.

Although Fitts List was originally published in 1951, the vast majority
of the statements still ring true today (after all humans have changed
very little in the last 70 years) but with advances in research and
technology, automation is now viewed on a sliding scale (from wholly
manual to wholly autonomous) This has recently been subject to
consideration by the Drilling Systems Automation Roadmap who have chosen
to adopt a 10-point level of automation taxonomy as follows \[Ref. 2\]:

> 1\. The computer offers no assistance, and the human must do it all
>
> 2\. The computer suggests alternative ways to do the task and the
> human selects from those suggestions and executes the task
>
> 3\. The computer selects one way to do the task, which triggers five
> possible scenarios including:

- the human executes that selection

- the computer executes that suggestion if the human approves

- the computer allows the human a restricted time to veto before
  automatic execution

- the computer executes the suggestion automatically necessarily informs
  the human

- the computer executes the suggestion automatically and informs the
  human only if asked

4\. The computer selects the method, executes the task, and ignores the
human.

Superficially, for highly complex systems, it may appear that there are
very few downsides to providing very high levels of automation with
little to no required user input. However, as is often stated, there is
no such thing as a 'free lunch' and there are often overlooked downsides
to providing high levels of automation usually termed the ‘Ironies of
Automation’ \[Ref. 3\] which must be suitably managed. Two examples of
this are:

> 1\. Any autonomous system is ultimately conceived and designed by
> humans – Attempts to design out the human merely shift the
> responsibility further up the chain. Operators involuntarily inherit
> the biases and Performance Shaping Factors that influenced the design
> team.
>
> 2\. The autonomous system cannot account for unforeseeable scenarios –
> This is one of the predominant reasons humans remain part of complex
> systems, to address the ‘unknown unknowns’. However, expecting human
> operators to flip between a passive ‘monitoring’ role and an active
> ‘doing’ role is difficult to achieve, they may be ‘out of the loop’
> and their Situation Awareness may be compromised.

Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your
‘projected’ drilling operator remains ‘in the loop’ through good
interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the
Drillbotics competition.
