The past years involved undergraduates, masters and doctoral students from a variety of disciplines who built innovative drilling machines and downhole tools while developing a deeper understanding of automating the drilling process. Recently, this was extended to include teams who created models of the rig, the drilling process, and various downhole interactions. Teams freely shared lessons learned, which more rapidly advances the science of drilling automation. Everyone involved claims to have had a lot of fun while learning things that are not in the textbooks or published papers. Students also participated in related events at conferences, workshop meetings and networking with industry leaders in drilling automation. This year’s contest promises to be just as challenging and hopefully as much fun.

They may compete like previous years, virtually drilling a directional well. Optionally, they may choose to focus on virtually detecting and controlling a well control event (e.g., kick). Group B will drill a 2-dimensional directional well under similar guidelines to last year, but may opt to drill a 3-dimensional well.</p> <p>New for 2024</p> <p>Continue with two groups</p> <p>A – Virtual</p> <p>B – Physical</p> <p>Separate guidelines for each group to reduce confusion</p> <p>Group A:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create model (or option to use publicly available models) to simulate a virtual rig, or</p> </li> <li> <p>Use their rig model to interface with a well control model provided by Norce using their OpenLab simulator.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Group B:</p> <ul> <li>Build and operate a physical rig to drill a 2D directional well or an optional 3D well.</li> </ul> <p>For A &amp; B: Additional credit for teams that develop a D-WIS compatible API for data interoperability.</p> <p>Okay for two schools to join together for their entry.</p> <p>New Group A teams are highly encouraged to use the OpenLab Drilling Simulator (<a href=https://openlab.app/ >https://openlab.app/</a>) and focus on designing the controls system. The D-WIS interface and connectivity will be used to send set-points to the simulator and receive surface and downhole sensor data. Webinar training on how to use the D-WIS interface and the simulator will be provided in October. Group B teams could use the simulator to validate and verify the interoperability of their API.</p> <p>Previously, teams reviewing the contest rules had to jump between the main body of the guidelines to various appendices depending on which group they chose. This year we have created separate guidelines for Groups A and B. The general information items that are common to both groups are identical. Rules specific to each group are listed in an appendix. Teams must also monitor the website (<a href=https://drillbotics.com>https://drillbotics.com</a>) to check any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) since they become part of these guidelines.</p> <p>How did the competition first come about? The origins began in 2008 when several SPE members established the Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) to help accelerate the uptake of automation in the drilling industry. DSATS’ goal was to link the surface machines with downhole machines, tools, and measurements in drilling systems automation (DSA), thereby improving drilling safety and efficiency. Later, at an SPE Forum in Paris, the idea of a student competition began to take shape; a DSATS sub-committee was formed to develop the competition format and guidelines further. Several universities were polled to find out the ability of academic institutions to create and manage multi-disciplinary teams. The Drillbotics committee began small in 2014-2015 to see if the format could succeed. With fine tuning, we continue along those lines as we start the 2024 process.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Competition Overview:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Group A</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1: The teams will design a control system that will virtually control their full-scale drilling system model to test and demonstrate their automated system’s capability to drill a directional well. The teams should incorporate virtual downhole and surface sensors in their automation and controls scheme. The well path will be defined by three targets provided by the Drillbotics Committee immediately before the final Phase II test. Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2: Teams may use the D-WIS interface standard to connect to an OpenLab simulator offered by Norce to detect and control an influx (kick).</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Group B</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li> <p>The challenge requires teams to develop a small-scale drilling rig and control system to autonomously drill a directional well following a given trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downhole sensors are mandatory, and their data must be included in the control algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>The well path will be defined by three targets provided by the Drillbotics Committee immediately before the final Phase II test. Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D trajectory.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Phase I</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li> <p>Both groups must submit a Phase I Design Report not later than 31 December.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Phase I Design Video is optional, due not later than 15 January.</p> </li> <li> <p>Judges will review the reports and select finalists to be announced in early February.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Phase II</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Teams will submit a pre-recorded team presentation approximately one week before the Phase II test. Judges will review the presentation and prepare a list of questions that will be asked of each team prior to the physical test.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Tests</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Group A and B Phase II tests will be held on separate dates, to be advised in April. If possible, we will hold face-to-face tests in Germany and the USA, with an option for a virtual meeting on the same dates.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The DSATS technical section believes that this challenge benefits students in several ways.  Petroleum, mechanical, electrical, and control engineers gain hands-on experience in each person’s area of expertise that forms a solid foundation for post-graduate careers. Those involved with system modeling gain insight into how models can gain sufficient fidelity to be applied to industry specific problems. They also learn where poor models or poor data can lead to incorrect outcomes. Students also develop experience working in multi-disciplinary teams, which is essential in today’s technology-driven industries.  Winning teams must possess a variety of skills.  The mechanical and electrical engineers need to build a stable, reliable, and functional drilling rig.  Control engineers need to architect a system for real-time control, including a selection of sensors, data handling, and fast-acting control algorithms.  The petroleum engineers need an understanding of drilling dysfunctions and mitigation techniques.  Modeling engineers must understand all of these basics and how to organize numerous modules into a complex model. Everyone must work collectively to establish functional system requirements, often fully understood by each team member to accurately portray the drilling issues and create an integrated package working seamlessly together.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry today seeks lower costs and reduced risk through efficiency and innovation.  Many student competitors may discover innovative tools and control processes that will assist drillers in speeding the time to drill and complete a well.  This includes more than a faster ROP, such as problem avoidance for dysfunctions like excessive vibrations, stuck pipe, and wellbore stability issues.  Student teams built new downhole tools using 3D printing techniques of designs that would be difficult, if not impossible to machine.  They used creative hoisting and lowering systems.  Teams modeled drilling performance in particular formations and adjusted the drilling parameters accordingly for changing downhole conditions.  While they have a lot to learn about our business, we have a lot to learn about their fresh approach to today’s problems. Good Luck!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Drillbotics® Committee</strong></p> <h3 id=contents>Contents<a class=headerlink href=#contents title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ul> <li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li> <li><a href=#objectives-for-the-2022-competition>Objectives for the 2022 Competition</a></li> <li><a href=#background>Background</a></li> <li><a href=#general-competition-guidelines>General Competition Guidelines</a></li> <li><a href=#team-members>Team Members</a></li> <li><a href=#safety>Safety</a></li> <li><a href=#expenditures>Expenditures</a></li> <li><a href=#other-considerations>Other Considerations</a></li> <li><a href=#project-timeline>Project Timeline</a></li> <li><a href=#project-reports>Project Reports</a></li> <li><a href=#group-a-and-group-b-prizes>Group A and Group B Prizes</a></li> <li><a href=#terms-and-conditions>Terms and Conditions</a></li> <li><a href=#marketing>Marketing</a></li> <li><a href=#appendix-a-group-b-project-definition>Appendix A: Group B Project Definition</a></li> <li><a href=#appendix-b-automation-interface-design-from-a-human-factors-perspective>Appendix B: Automation &amp; Interface Design</a></li> <li><a href=#appendix-c-additional-references>Appendix C: Additional References</a></li> </ul> <h3 id=objectives-for-the-2022-competition>Objectives for the 2022 Competition<a class=headerlink href=#objectives-for-the-2022-competition title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ol> <li> <p>During the school year, beginning in the fall of 2023, a team of students will organize themselves to solve a drilling-related problem outlined in Appendix A below. The team should preferably be a multi-disciplinary team that will bring unique skills to the group to allow them to design and construct hardware, software and models to demonstrate that they understand the underlying physics, the drilling issues and the usual means to mitigate the issues. We cannot stress enough the need to involve students with different technical training and backgrounds. They will need to develop skills to understand drilling dysfunctions and mitigation strategies, but they must also have the mechanical engineering and controls capabilities to model, design the rig/drilling package and develop the controls system. Even when the project involves only software, an understanding of the physical limits of a rig’s machinery and tubulars is critical. In past years, some entrants have not adequately considered the control network and algorithms needed for autonomous drilling. They have often misunderstood the need for calibrated sensors and fast, accurate data handling. Some teams did not consider measurement errors. Teams from both Group A and B ignored uncertainty principles. All of this and more is needed to build and operate a complete automated drilling system. We encourage all teams to start out with a simple concept done well, and then build on it from year to year adding complexity when warranted. Planning for this evolution will make it easier on future team members.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students should produce novel ideas leading to new drilling models, improved drilling machines and sensors, and the ability to integrate the data, models and machines that will hopefully create new, more efficient ways to drill wells in the future. Any such innovation will belong to the students and their university in accordance with the university’s written policies. DSATS and SPE waive any claims to students’ intellectual property.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students, working as a multi-disciplinary team, will gain hands-on experience that will be directly applicable to a career in the upstream drilling industry.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id=background>Background<a class=headerlink href=#background title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ol> <li>What is DSATS?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS is a technical section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) organized to promote the adoption of automation techniques using surface and downhole machines and instrumentation to improve the safety and efficiency of the drilling process. More information is available about DSATS at the <a href=https://www.spe-dsats.org/ >DSATS homepage</a>.</p> <ol> <li>Why an international competition?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS and the other technical sections, as part of the SPE, are a group of volunteers from many nations, connected by their belief that drilling automation will have a long-term, positive influence on the drilling industry. This diversity helped to shape the direction of the organization. The group feels that the industry needs to attract young professionals from all cultures and disciplines to advance drilling practices in all areas of the world. The winners of the competition will receive a grant for economy class transportation and accommodations to attend the next SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and will present an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro<sup id=fnref:1><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:1>1</a></sup>. Note that this year, the Drillbotics Committee will submit both Group A and Group B winning abstracts to the conference program committee. They will choose which of the two abstracts best fit their program. The Drillbotics committee will help the winning team from the other Group receive recognition of their achievement and have the opportunity via a different conference<sup id=fnref:2><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:2>2</a></sup> to publish an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro. DSATS believes recognition at one of the industry’s leading technical conferences will demonstrate to industry leaders the extent of research and understanding the student teams have gained during the contest. Also, the practical experience with drilling automation systems increases the students’ visibility to the companies that are leading automation activities.</p> <ol> <li>Why include a safety case</li> </ol> <p>Safety of personnel, equipment and the environment are always critical for any drilling operation. The industry begins any project or operation with safety in mind, and a safety case is a proven method of identifying and mitigating risks. This is no different on a small scale or for a virual operation. Safety goes far beyond personal protective equipment. Where can someone be hurt – in a lab with heavy rock samples and rotating machinery? Electrocution? High pressure leaks? Traveling to and from locations? Judges want to see how teams plan ahead in their first few meetings to identify threats and develop processes or devices to reduce the risk and severity of any incidents.</p> <ol> <li>Why include Human Factors?</li> </ol> <p>Any complex engineered system that is wholly reliant upon human operators to achieve its goal is likely to experience issues. Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation. Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your ‘projected’ drilling operator remains ‘in the loop’ through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition. It is imperative that teams show how they implemented human factors in their processes and interfaces, both in the creation of their rig or model and how the operators/judges will use their designs.</p> <p>Students working with automated systems should learn about the risks and proper strategies to allow humans and machines to work together safely and efficiently. Reference documents are listed in Appendix B. Requirements for human factors provisions are shown in Appendix A.</p> <ol> <li>Items posted on the website are part of these Guidelines</li> </ol> <p>The Drillbotics website at (<a href=https://drillbotics.com>https://drillbotics.com</a>) includes official updates to the competition guidelines and schedule, as well as FAQs, photos, and previous entrants’ submittals and reports and numerous reference documents. <strong>Any updates to the guidelines posted on the Drillbotics website via FAQs or blog entries from the Committee are considered to be an official revision to these Guidelines.</strong></p> <ol> <li>Questions should be directed to the competition email at <a href=mailto:competition@drillbotics.com>competition@drillbotics.com</a>. Teams must provide the reference number of the section of the guideless when you ask questions. Questions and answers will be incorporated into the FAQs periodically.</li> </ol> <h3 id=general-competition-guidelines>General Competition Guidelines<a class=headerlink href=#general-competition-guidelines title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ol> <li> <p>Entrants to Group A challenge have the option to sign up to do a well control challenge. They will need to use OpenLab Drilling simulator (<a href=https://openlab.app/ >https://openlab.app/</a>) with the D-WIS interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teams also have the option to work on a 2D or optional 3D steering challenge. They will develop a drilling system model that represents a full-scale system and corresponding control scheme to virtually drill a directional well to a given trajectory as efficiently as possible within constraints of safety and economics.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Group A challenge does not involve building a rig or drilling system. The teams will design automation and control modules to develop a virtual drilling system (i.e., computer models) to test and demonstrate the controls. Teams that develop modules that can updated in future years find that their code is stronger than a complete re-write.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Group B challenge requires the design, construction, and operation of a physical mini-rig to physically drill a directional well to a given trajectory as efficiently as possible within constraints of safety and economics. Teams may work on a 2D or optional 3D steering challenge. The guidelines for Group B are published separately.</p> </li> <li> <p>The contest covers only the drilling of one hole section. There is no need to run casing. There is no need for automated pipe handling at the surface. There is no logging or cementing. This is just a drilling problem. However, teams should consider sampling and surveying and dealing with uncertainty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Judges want to see evidence that teams know about drilling and modeling aspects of well construction. Because teams will either build or model a physical rig and downhole conditions, they must specify the assumptions made about their project. Allowing judges to understand “why” you made certain choices affecting the evaluation of your project.</p> </li> <li> <p>While the teams will have to meet minimum competition requirements, any exceptional contributions “above and beyond” the main theme will be rewarded with additional points to encourage creativity and innovation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teams are free to choose the hardware and software most suited to their design except where explicitly specified. Teams are free to choose any software language. Judges would like to see an explanation of the reason certain hardware or software was selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teams are encouraged to review the design reports, presentations, and test recordings available on the website, since these include designs that worked or didn’t work and students thoughts about their earlier choices.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id=team-members>Team Members<a class=headerlink href=#team-members title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ol> <li> <p>DSATS envisions that the students would be at least at the senior undergraduate or Masters level, well versed in the disciplines needed for such a project. The core team shall consist of at least three (3) team members and no more than five (5). Contributions from other team members is allowed, and all contributors should be recognized in the Phase I Design Report. The travel grant for the winning team will be limited to five (5) team members and one (1) supervisor due to budget constraints.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any team that loses team members during the project can recruit a replacement. Note any changes to the team membership or the faculty advisor in the monthly reports. Include the email address of the new member(s). At least one member of the core team must be a Petroleum Engineering candidate with sufficient coursework completed to understand the physics relating to the drilling problems and the normal industry practices used to mitigate the problem. For universities that do not have a petroleum engineering program, two schools may join efforts to compete as a single entity (see 5.6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Students with a background in mining, applied mathematics, mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as controls, mechatronics and automation or software development, are the most likely candidates, but students with any applicable background is encouraged.</p> </li> <li> <p>A multi-disciplinary team simulates the working environment in the drilling industry today, as most products and services are produced with the cooperation of technical personnel from differing backgrounds and cultures.</p> </li> <li> <p>A university may enter more than one team in a group and may enter teams in one or both groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>A collaboration between not more than two universities is allowed, especially where one school may not offer a curriculum in a specific technical area needed to successfully conduct the project. The resulting team may only submit one Phase I design report. Also, the travel grant will still be limited to five (5) students and one (1) supervisor. Note: Any differences with intellectual property ownership between the two schools must be settled by the teams and shall not involve DSATS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Students shall register their team not later than 15 October using the registration form on the Drillbotics website <a href=https://drillbotics.com/guidelines/ >https://drillbotics.com/guidelines/</a>.

Personal protective equipment is part of a safety plan but is far from sufficient. Teams must consider risks due to handling the rock, rotating machinery, electrical shock and others. What health considerations are in place? How the team communicates with each other before and during operations is also important. Judges will grade each team on its comprehensive safety plan. This applies to both Group A and Group B.</p> </li> <li> <p>Because most of the Group B rigs have equipment spinning at high RPMs, some form of protective cover must be included in the team’s rig design. A broken coupling, a loose screw or similar item becomes a projectile that can lead to serious injury to the team members, judges or visitors. Judges may decide to deny a team from competing if their design is unsafe. Similarly, Group A teams may be excluded if they have not met proper health and safety considerations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The following links are a good starting point, but is by no means a comprehensive list of links:</p> <ol> <li> <p>OSHA Pocket Guide, Worker Safety Series: <a href=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html>https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html</a></p> </li> <li> <p>OSHA Checklist for General Industry: <a href=http://www.scosha.llronline.com/pdfs/genind.pdf>http://www.scosha.llronline.com/pdfs/genind.pdf</a></p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h3 id=expenditures>Expenditures<a class=headerlink href=#expenditures title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ol> <li> <p>Teams selected to advance to the second phase must limit the cost of the physical or virtual rig and materials to US$ 10,000 per year or its equivalent in other currencies.

Who are the operators of your drilling rig and how do their
    characteristics impact the design?

2. Which functions of your drilling rig will be automated, and
    which will be manual (refer to Ref. 2)?

3. How are you going to ensure that the operator remains &#39;in the
    loop&#39; at all times?

4. The workflow that your drilling rig will follow (very important
    as this will guide your interface design).

5. The control and feedback needs for your defined operators.

6. The &#39;concept&#39; of your interface design. This can be as simple as
    a &#39;wireframe&#39; drawing with pen and paper, but it should show an
    appreciation of Human Factors Relevant Good Practice (refer to
    the resources provided below).

Scoring for the directional competition objective will be primarily based on how accurately the directional targets are intersected by the calculated well trajectory.  An example of the criteria for scoring is included below.</p> <p>The end goal is for teams to develop a mini-rig with automated controls to drill autonomously prepare a planned well path once the target points are established.  The well directional well should be drilled as close to the targets as is practical, keeping in mind build rates, wellbore tortuosity, and overcoming drilling dysfunctions while operating within the limits imposed by the drilling equipment and drillstring.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id=objectives_1>Objectives<a class=headerlink href=#objectives_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ol> <li> <p>Hit one or more targets at one or more vertical depth(s) and X/Y coordinates.</p> </li> <li> <p>For the Group B competition, the starting directional plan to hit the targets will not require wellbore inclinations in excess of 30° from vertical, 15° change in azimuth, or 10” displacement (departure from the vertical axis at well center) The max displacement/inclination/azimuth are total/accumulated from the start to the end of the well path.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please note: Teams should be prepared to drill any given trajectory within the specified parameters, so the coordinates will not be provided in advance of the test.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teams must deal with multiple constraints like those faced by practicing drilling engineers designing difficult wells. Each team should design their own well trajectory plan after receiving competition targets. Their systems should autonomously determine the trajectory, taking into consideration the physical limitations that they have defined for their specific system. If a team feels that their system will not be able to hit the targets, the plan should be designed to get as close to the targets as possible. Judges will assess your assumptions and calculations to see how well you understand the issues.

Appropriate statistical measurements should be made at frequencies and with an accuracy and appropriate frequency content for the dynamics of the drilling system both at surface and downhole.  Discussion of such choices should be included in the design report.</p> <ol> <li>Distinguish in all data and documentation the difference between Weight-On-Bit and Hook Load; be specific when referring to these parameters.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>A closed-loop fluid circulation system is not required, but could be of advantage for directional drilling, the bit and machinery should be cooled with air or fluid/water if needed.  The design of the fluid system, if any, should be included in the Phase I design.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The rock sample will be homogeneous and will be capable of aiding in closed-loop fluid circulation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that the rock samples will leak once the drillbit punctures a rock face, so a rig design that includes a containment system is required.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h4 id=design-calculations>Design Calculations<a class=headerlink href=#design-calculations title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ol> <li> <p>Design submittal by the students shall include:</p> <ol> <li>Engineering drawings of the rig concept, mechanical and electrical and auxiliary systems, if any</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Design notes and calculations</p> <ol> <li> <p>All engineering calculations shall be included in the Phase I report, even if the rig is built using previous years’ designs.

Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation.</p> <p>The concept that 'machines' (read automation) are better at some tasks than humans and vice versa has been prevalent for decades. The original incarnation of this notion was presented in 'Fitts List' [Ref. 1]. 'Fitts List' is 11 statements designed to provide guidance on 'what humans are best at' compared to 'what machines are best at' for example:</p> <p>Humans surpass machines in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to improvise and use flexible procedures'</li> </ul> <p>Machines surpass humans in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to handle highly complex operations i.e., to do many different things at once'.</li> </ul> <p>Although Fitts List was originally published in 1951, the vast majority of the statements still ring true today (after all humans have changed very little in the last 70 years) but with advances in research and technology, automation is now viewed on a sliding scale (from wholly manual to wholly autonomous) This has recently been subject to consideration by the Drilling Systems Automation Roadmap who have chosen to adopt a 10-point level of automation taxonomy as follows [Ref. 2]:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The computer offers no assistance, and the human must do it all</p> <p>2. The computer suggests alternative ways to do the task and the human selects from those suggestions and executes the task</p> <p>3. The computer selects one way to do the task, which triggers five possible scenarios including:</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li> <p>the human executes that selection</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes that suggestion if the human approves</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer allows the human a restricted time to veto before automatic execution</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically necessarily informs the human</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically and informs the human only if asked</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. The computer selects the method, executes the task, and ignores the human.</p> <p>Superficially, for highly complex systems, it may appear that there are very few downsides to providing very high levels of automation with little to no required user input. However, as is often stated, there is no such thing as a 'free lunch' and there are often overlooked downsides to providing high levels of automation usually termed the ‘Ironies of Automation’ [Ref. 3] which must be suitably managed. Two examples of this are:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. Any autonomous system is ultimately conceived and designed by humans – Attempts to design out the human merely shift the responsibility further up the chain. Operators involuntarily inherit the biases and Performance Shaping Factors that influenced the design team.</p> <p>2. The autonomous system cannot account for unforeseeable scenarios – This is one of the predominant reasons humans remain part of complex systems, to address the ‘unknown unknowns’. However, expecting human operators to flip between a passive ‘monitoring’ role and an active ‘doing’ role is difficult to achieve, they may be ‘out of the loop’ and their Situation Awareness may be compromised.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your ‘projected’ drilling operator remains ‘in the loop’ through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition.</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p>The following resources have been selected to assist you in the design of your drilling interface and the levels of autonomy you decide upon. Where possible free resources have been chosen (either available through OnePetro or elsewhere on the Internet) but two textbooks have also been selected as they offer an excellent primer on usability heuristics and the importance of good design.</p> <p>1. de Winter JCF, Hancock PA.
