The past years involved undergraduates, masters and doctoral students from a variety of disciplines who built innovative drilling machines and downhole tools while developing a deeper understanding of automating the drilling process. Recently, this was extended to include teams who created models of the rig, the drilling process, and various downhole interactions. Teams freely shared lessons learned, which more rapidly advances the science of drilling automation. Everyone involved claims to have had a lot of fun while learning things that are not in the textbooks or published papers. Students also participated in related events at conferences, workshop meetings and networking with industry leaders in drilling automation. This year\u2019s contest promises to be just as challenging and hopefully as much fun. For more information, see https://drillbotics.com/</p> <p>This year\u2019s Group A competition again allows teams two options. They may compete like previous years, virtually drilling a directional well. Optionally, they may choose to focus on virtually detecting and controlling a well control event (e.g., kick). Group B will drill a 2-dimensional directional well under similar guidelines to last year, but may opt to drill a 3-dimensional well.</p> <p>New for 2024</p> <p>Continue with two groups</p> <p>A \u2013 Virtual</p> <p>B \u2013 Physical</p> <p>Separate guidelines for each group to reduce confusion</p> <p>Group A:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create model (or option to use publicly available models) to simulate a virtual rig, or</p> </li> <li> <p>Use their rig model to interface with a well control model provided by Norce using their OpenLab simulator.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Group B:</p> <ul> <li>Build and operate a physical rig to drill a 2D directional well or an optional 3D well.</li> </ul> <p>For A &amp; B: Additional credit for teams that develop a D-WIS compatible API for data interoperability.</p> <p>Okay for two schools to join together for their entry.</p> <p>New Group A teams are highly encouraged to use the OpenLab Drilling Simulator (https://openlab.app/) and focus on designing the controls system. The D-WIS interface and connectivity will be used to send set-points to the simulator and receive surface and downhole sensor data. Webinar training on how to use the D-WIS interface and the simulator will be provided in October. Group B teams could use the simulator to validate and verify the interoperability of their API.</p> <p>Previously, teams reviewing the contest rules had to jump between the main body of the guidelines to various appendices depending on which group they chose. This year we have created separate guidelines for Groups A and B. The general information items that are common to both groups are identical. Rules specific to each group are listed in an appendix. Teams must also monitor the website (www.Drillbotics.com) to check any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) since they become part of these guidelines.</p> <p>How did the competition first come about? The origins began in 2008 when several SPE members established the Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) to help accelerate the uptake of automation in the drilling industry. DSATS\u2019 goal was to link the surface machines with downhole machines, tools, and measurements in drilling systems automation (DSA), thereby improving drilling safety and efficiency. Later, at an SPE Forum in Paris, the idea of a student competition began to take shape; a DSATS sub-committee was formed to develop the competition format and guidelines further. Several universities were polled to find out the ability of academic institutions to create and manage multi-disciplinary teams. The Drillbotics committee began small in 2014-2015 to see if the format could succeed. With fine tuning, we continue along those lines as we start the 2024 process.</p> <p>Competition Overview:</p> <p>Group A</p> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1: The teams will design a control system that will virtually   control their full-scale drilling system model to test and demonstrate   their automated system\u2019s capability to drill a directional well. The   teams should incorporate virtual downhole and surface sensors in their   automation and controls scheme. The well path will be defined by three   targets provided by the Drillbotics Committee immediately before the   final Phase II test. Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D   trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2: Teams may use the D-WIS interface standard to connect to an   OpenLab simulator offered by Norce to detect and control an influx   (kick).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Group B</p> <ul> <li> <p>The challenge requires teams to develop a small-scale drilling rig and   control system to autonomously drill a directional well following a   given trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downhole sensors are mandatory, and their data must be included in the   control algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>The well path will be defined by three targets provided by the   Drillbotics Committee immediately before the final Phase II test.   Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D trajectory.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Phase I</p> <ul> <li> <p>Both groups must submit a Phase I Design Report not later than 31   December.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Phase I Design Video is optional, due not later than 15 January.</p> </li> <li> <p>Judges will review the reports and select finalists to be announced in   early February.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Phase II</p> <ul> <li>Teams will submit a pre-recorded team presentation approximately one   week before the Phase II test. Judges will review the presentation and   prepare a list of questions that will be asked of each team prior to   the physical test.</li> </ul> <p>Tests</p> <ul> <li>Group A and B Phase II tests will be held on separate dates, to be   advised in April. If possible, we will hold face-to-face tests in   Germany and the USA, with an option for a virtual meeting on the same   dates.</li> </ul> <p>The DSATS technical section believes that this challenge benefits students in several ways.\u00a0 Petroleum, mechanical, electrical, and control engineers gain hands-on experience in each person\u2019s area of expertise that forms a solid foundation for post-graduate careers. Those involved with system modeling gain insight into how models can gain sufficient fidelity to be applied to industry specific problems. They also learn where poor models or poor data can lead to incorrect outcomes. Students also develop experience working in multi-disciplinary teams, which is essential in today\u2019s technology-driven industries.\u00a0 Winning teams must possess a variety of skills.\u00a0 The mechanical and electrical engineers need to build a stable, reliable, and functional drilling rig.\u00a0 Control engineers need to architect a system for real-time control, including a selection of sensors, data handling, and fast-acting control algorithms.\u00a0 The petroleum engineers need an understanding of drilling dysfunctions and mitigation techniques.\u00a0 Modeling engineers must understand all of these basics and how to organize numerous modules into a complex model. Everyone must work collectively to establish functional system requirements, often fully understood by each team member to accurately portray the drilling issues and create an integrated package working seamlessly together.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry today seeks lower costs and reduced risk through efficiency and innovation.\u00a0 Many student competitors may discover innovative tools and control processes that will assist drillers in speeding the time to drill and complete a well.\u00a0 This includes more than a faster ROP, such as problem avoidance for dysfunctions like excessive vibrations, stuck pipe, and wellbore stability issues.\u00a0 Student teams built new downhole tools using 3D printing techniques of designs that would be difficult, if not impossible to machine.\u00a0 They used creative hoisting and lowering systems.\u00a0 Teams modeled drilling performance in particular formations and adjusted the drilling parameters accordingly for changing downhole conditions.\u00a0 While they have a lot to learn about our business, we have a lot to learn about their fresh approach to today\u2019s problems.

The team should preferably be     a multi-disciplinary team that will bring unique skills to the group     to allow them to design and construct hardware, software and models     to demonstrate that they understand the underlying physics, the     drilling issues and the usual means to mitigate the issues. We     cannot stress enough the need to involve students with different     technical training and backgrounds. They will need to develop skills     to understand drilling dysfunctions and mitigation strategies, but     they must also have the mechanical engineering and controls     capabilities to model, design the rig/drilling package and develop     the controls system. Even when the project involves only software,     an understanding of the physical limits of a rig\u2019s machinery and     tubulars is critical. In past years, some entrants have not     adequately considered the control network and algorithms needed for     autonomous drilling. They have often misunderstood the need for     calibrated sensors and fast, accurate data handling. Some teams did     not consider measurement errors. Teams from both Group A and B     ignored uncertainty principles. All of this and more is needed to     build and operate a complete automated drilling system. We encourage     all teams to start out with a simple concept done well, and then     build on it from year to year adding complexity when warranted.     Planning for this evolution will make it easier on future team     members.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students should produce novel ideas leading to new drilling     models, improved drilling machines and sensors, and the ability to     integrate the data, models and machines that will hopefully create     new, more efficient ways to drill wells in the future. Any such     innovation will belong to the students and their university in     accordance with the university\u2019s written policies. DSATS and SPE     waive any claims to students\u2019 intellectual property.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students, working as a multi-disciplinary team, will gain     hands-on experience that will be directly applicable to a career in     the upstream drilling industry.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["archive","2024","group-a"]},{"location":"2024/group-a/#background","title":"Background","text":"<ol> <li>What is DSATS?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS is a technical section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) organized to promote the adoption of automation techniques using surface and downhole machines and instrumentation to improve the safety and efficiency of the drilling process. More information is available at https://www.spe-dsats.org/.</p> <ol> <li>Why an international competition?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS and the other technical sections, as part of the SPE, are a group of volunteers from many nations, connected by their belief that drilling automation will have a long-term, positive influence on the drilling industry. This diversity helped to shape the direction of the organization. The group feels that the industry needs to attract young professionals from all cultures and disciplines to advance drilling practices in all areas of the world. The winners of the competition will receive a grant for economy class transportation and accommodations to attend the next SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and will present an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro<sup>1</sup>. Note that this year, the Drillbotics Committee will submit both Group A and Group B winning abstracts to the conference program committee. They will choose which of the two abstracts best fit their program. The Drillbotics committee will help the winning team from the other Group receive recognition of their achievement and have the opportunity via a different conference<sup>2</sup> to publish an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro. DSATS believes recognition at one of the industry\u2019s leading technical conferences will demonstrate to industry leaders the extent of research and understanding the student teams have gained during the contest. Also, the practical experience with drilling automation systems increases the students\u2019 visibility to the companies that are leading automation activities.</p> <ol> <li>Why include a safety case</li> </ol> <p>Safety of personnel, equipment and the environment are always critical for any drilling operation. The industry begins any project or operation with safety in mind, and a safety case is a proven method of identifying and mitigating risks. This is no different on a small scale or for a virtual operation. Safety goes far beyond personal protective equipment. Where can someone be hurt \u2013 in a lab with heavy rock samples and rotating machinery? Electrocution? High pressure leaks? Traveling to and from locations? Judges want to see how teams plan ahead in their first few meetings to identify threats and develop processes or devices to reduce the risk and severity of any incidents.</p> <ol> <li>Why include Human Factors?</li> </ol> <p>Any complex engineered system that is wholly reliant upon human operators to achieve its goal is likely to experience issues. Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation. Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your \u2018projected\u2019 drilling operator remains \u2018in the loop\u2019 through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition. It is imperative that teams show how they implemented human factors in their processes and interfaces, both in the creation of their rig or model and how the operators/judges will use their designs.</p> <p>Students working with automated systems should learn about the risks and proper strategies to allow humans and machines to work together safely and efficiently. Reference documents are listed in Appendix B. Requirements for human factors provisions are shown in Appendix A.</p> <ol> <li>Items posted on the website are part of these Guidelines</li> </ol> <p>The Drillbotics website at www.Drillbotics.com includes official updates to the competition guidelines and schedule, as well as FAQs, photos, and previous entrants\u2019 submittals and reports and numerous reference documents.

The Drillbotics committee will provide certain information in advance but will not provide the actual well targets until the day of the Phase II test. The following attached pages describe the directional objectives as well as the data/deliverables requirements. Scoring for the directional competition objective will be primarily based on how accurately the directional targets are intersected by the calculated well trajectory. An example of the criteria for scoring is included below.</p> <p>The end goal is for teams to develop a virtual drilling model and a control model to drill a well virtually. The details in the sections below are some recommendations on what you will have to consider when building the virtual drilling model. You and your team will have to determine what physics of the drilling process you want to model. But keep in mind that the competition challenge is to drill a directional well virtually to specified targets.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Teams should list key rig equipment used in their model and describe     any specific equipment limitations. For example, if the team uses a     top drive for torque and rotation, indicate what model top drive is     modeled. Consider items such as maximum torque at a specific RPM.     Teams should understand if their model requests torque or speed in     excess of the equipment limits it negatively affects the fidelity of     their model.</p> </li> <li> <p>The rig model will typically consist of a hoist, usually a drawworks     with drill line on a drum, a top drive providing the torque and RPM.     The RPM, Torque, and Hookload are measurements taken at the rig     model and will be inputs into the Control System.</p> </li> <li> <p>The downhole drilling system model should predict bit trajectory for     given WOB, RPM, drive mechanism parameters (e.g. steering force, AKO     angle), and rock strength \u2013 as a function of measured depth. While     the teams are empowered to decide on the complexity of the     simulation model, the minimum requirements are stated below.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another consideration is the delays inherent in taking surveys. If     your model assumes continuous surveys only available with high-speed     telemetry systems, that should be stated in your list of     assumptions. If you assume that the survey is coming from a MWD or     RSS tool, use frequencies and intervals that are more realistic to     those systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the impact of survey errors and cumulative errors for your     model to make it more realistic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine the appropriate update rates for each cycle within your     model. Depending on how simple or complex your design your system,     this may be one rate for the entire model or you may have some     modules running at a different rate. If so, explain how you manage     the synchronization of time across various modules.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Teams may choose to iterate based on time or depth, but they     must ensure that survey course lengths are appropriate for the     dogleg severities being surveyed. It\u2019s typically recommended to     not have survey intervals exceed 10m-13m (30ft \u2013 50ft) in length     for accurate wellbore placement. This should be considered in     the control scheme if time-based survey intervals are being     used.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you include modules to introduce drilling dysfunction and     mitigation techniques, you may increase the functionality of     your overall model but risk not meeting the project timeline or     ending up with stability issues with you model. Explain how you     chose which items to include or exclude.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you do choose to simulate full-scale rig effects, explain     what frequencies you selected appropriate for the dynamics of     the drilling system both at surface and downhole. Or you may     have chosen a simpler design just for lab use. Discussion of     such choices should be included in the design report.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you choose to include alerts for equipment or drilling     dysfunctions, consider a plan for managing alerts that inform     the observer without overwhelming them with too many alerts.     Consider some of the references in Appendix C.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional optional items for the directional drilling option:</p> <ol> <li> <p>If you choose a course that does not intersect with a     target, but lies within an acceptable proximity to the     target, explain your choice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since this is a directional drilling problem, be sure to     include how simulated downhole data is used for steering and     other drilling aspects?

The BHA     should also (virtually) measure certain parameters (such as     inclination, RPM, vibration etc.) and return to the surface or the     control system. The bit-to-sensor distance as well as measurement     frequency (i.e., intermittent vs continuous survey) should be     configurable parameters in the design.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teams are not required, but may consider whether their model assumes     that the pipe will be subject to the same radius of curvature as the     well trajectory. Consideration should include drill pipe,     connections and BHA (versus one continuous section of drill pipe).     What are the external bending moments and forces? How will this     affect stress/strain? The pipe clearance from the wellbore wall may     allow it to have a less severe bend and the connection points would     also influence the stress/strain of the pipe body. Another question     is whether plastic deformation should be allowed?</p> </li> </ol> <ol> <li></li> </ol>","tags":["archive","2024","group-a"]},{"location":"2024/group-a/#well-control-criteria","title":"Well Control Criteria","text":"","tags":["archive","2024","group-a"]},{"location":"2024/group-a/#overview_1","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Teams will use the OpenLab Drilling simulator (https://openlab.app/) as the model for the drilling process and develop appropriate controls to detect and control a well control issue.</p> <ol> <li> <p>We will package in a Docker container an OPC UA server with the     D-WIS connectivity from which the students can connect to the     OpenLab Drilling simulator.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each team will run the Docker image on their computer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Their program can access the local OPC-UA following the D-WIS     interface and they can send set-points to the simulator and receive     measurements from the virtual sensors on the simulator.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Docker image will make it possible to access a few different     test cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>The day of the competition, we will change the access to the     simulator on one of the accessible test cases where we will have     prepared a different drilling configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p>The trajectory, wellbore geometry, geo-pressure margins, drilling     fluid characteristics, drill-string, available sensors at the rig     will all be different for each of the available training cases and     will be again different during the day of the competition.

Be prepared to model a push-the-bit RSS     and a bent motor AKO. The steering model should include     considerations for how often the survey is taken and how far     from the bit the sensors are placed (e.g., projecting from the     survey depth to the bit, and the control system using survey     information to decide steering parameters).</p> </li> <li> <p>Rig Display: Real-time display of the drilling parameters     and wellbore positioning during the final testing is mandatory.

Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation.</p> <p>The concept that 'machines' (read automation) are better at some tasks than humans and vice versa has been prevalent for decades. The original incarnation of this notion was presented in 'Fitts List' [Ref. 1]. 'Fitts List' is 11 statements designed to provide guidance on 'what humans are best at' compared to 'what machines are best at' for example:</p> <p>Humans surpass machines in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to improvise and use flexible procedures'</li> </ul> <p>Machines surpass humans in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to handle highly complex operations i.e., to do many   different things at once'.</li> </ul> <p>Although Fitts List was originally published in 1951, the vast majority of the statements still ring true today (after all humans have changed very little in the last 70 years) but with advances in research and technology, automation is now viewed on a sliding scale (from wholly manual to wholly autonomous) This has recently been subject to consideration by the Drilling Systems Automation Roadmap who have chosen to adopt a 10-point level of automation taxonomy as follows [Ref. 2]:</p> <p>1. The computer offers no assistance, and the human must do it all</p> <p>2. The computer suggests alternative ways to do the task and the human selects from those suggestions and executes the task</p> <p>3. The computer selects one way to do the task, which triggers five possible scenarios including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the human executes that selection</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes that suggestion if the human approves</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer allows the human a restricted time to veto before   automatic execution</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically necessarily informs   the human</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically and informs the   human only if asked</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. The computer selects the method, executes the task, and ignores the human.</p> <p>Superficially, for highly complex systems, it may appear that there are very few downsides to providing very high levels of automation with little to no required user input. However, as is often stated, there is no such thing as a 'free lunch' and there are often overlooked downsides to providing high levels of automation usually termed the \u2018Ironies of Automation\u2019 [Ref. 3] which must be suitably managed. Two examples of this are:</p> <p>1. Any autonomous system is ultimately conceived and designed by humans \u2013 Attempts to design out the human merely shift the responsibility further up the chain. Operators involuntarily inherit the biases and Performance Shaping Factors that influenced the design team.</p> <p>2. The autonomous system cannot account for unforeseeable scenarios \u2013 This is one of the predominant reasons humans remain part of complex systems, to address the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019. However, expecting human operators to flip between a passive \u2018monitoring\u2019 role and an active \u2018doing\u2019 role is difficult to achieve, they may be \u2018out of the loop\u2019 and their Situation Awareness may be compromised.</p> <p>Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your \u2018projected\u2019 drilling operator remains \u2018in the loop\u2019 through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition.</p> <p>Resources</p> <p>The following resources have been selected to assist you in the design of your drilling interface and the levels of autonomy you decide upon. Where possible free resources have been chosen (either available through OnePetro or elsewhere on the Internet) but two textbooks have also been selected as they offer an excellent primer on usability heuristics and the importance of good design.</p> <p>1. de Winter JCF, Hancock PA.

The past years involved undergraduates, masters and doctoral students from a variety of disciplines who built innovative drilling machines and downhole tools while developing a deeper understanding of automating the drilling process. Recently, this was extended to include teams who created models of the rig, the drilling process, and various downhole interactions. Teams freely shared lessons learned, which more rapidly advances the science of drilling automation. Everyone involved claims to have had a lot of fun while learning things that are not in the textbooks or published papers. Students also participated in related events at conferences, workshop meetings and networking with industry leaders in drilling automation. This year\u2019s contest promises to be just as challenging and hopefully as much fun. For more information, see https://drillbotics.com/</p> <p>This year\u2019s Group A competition again allows teams two options. They may compete like previous years, virtually drilling a directional well. Optionally, they may choose to focus on virtually detecting and controlling a well control event (e.g., kick). Group B will drill a 2-dimensional directional well under similar guidelines to last year, but may opt to drill a 3-dimensional well.</p> <p>New for 2024</p> <p>Continue with two groups</p> <p>A \u2013 Virtual</p> <p>B \u2013 Physical</p> <p>Separate guidelines for each group to reduce confusion</p> <p>Group A:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create model (or option to use publicly available models) to simulate a virtual rig, or</p> </li> <li> <p>Use their rig model to interface with a well control model provided by Norce using their OpenLab simulator.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Group B:</p> <ul> <li>Build and operate a physical rig to drill a 2D directional well or an optional 3D well.</li> </ul> <p>For A &amp; B: Additional credit for teams that develop a D-WIS compatible API for data interoperability.</p> <p>Okay for two schools to join together for their entry.</p> <p>New Group A teams are highly encouraged to use the OpenLab Drilling Simulator (https://openlab.app/) and focus on designing the controls system. The D-WIS interface and connectivity will be used to send set-points to the simulator and receive surface and downhole sensor data. Webinar training on how to use the D-WIS interface and the simulator will be provided in October. Group B teams could use the simulator to validate and verify the interoperability of their API.</p> <p>Previously, teams reviewing the contest rules had to jump between the main body of the guidelines to various appendices depending on which group they chose. This year we have created separate guidelines for Groups A and B. The general information items that are common to both groups are identical. Rules specific to each group are listed in an appendix. Teams must also monitor the website (https://drillbotics.com) to check any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) since they become part of these guidelines.</p> <p>How did the competition first come about? The origins began in 2008 when several SPE members established the Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) to help accelerate the uptake of automation in the drilling industry. DSATS\u2019 goal was to link the surface machines with downhole machines, tools, and measurements in drilling systems automation (DSA), thereby improving drilling safety and efficiency. Later, at an SPE Forum in Paris, the idea of a student competition began to take shape; a DSATS sub-committee was formed to develop the competition format and guidelines further. Several universities were polled to find out the ability of academic institutions to create and manage multi-disciplinary teams. The Drillbotics committee began small in 2014-2015 to see if the format could succeed. With fine tuning, we continue along those lines as we start the 2024 process.</p> <p>Competition Overview:</p> <p>Group A</p> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1: The teams will design a control system that will virtually   control their full-scale drilling system model to test and demonstrate   their automated system\u2019s capability to drill a directional well. The   teams should incorporate virtual downhole and surface sensors in their   automation and controls scheme. The well path will be defined by three   targets provided by the Drillbotics Committee immediately before the   final Phase II test. Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D   trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2: Teams may use the D-WIS interface standard to connect to an   OpenLab simulator offered by Norce to detect and control an influx   (kick).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Group B</p> <ul> <li> <p>The challenge requires teams to develop a small-scale drilling rig and   control system to autonomously drill a directional well following a   given trajectory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downhole sensors are mandatory, and their data must be included in the   control algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>The well path will be defined by three targets provided by the   Drillbotics Committee immediately before the final Phase II test.   Teams can drill a 2D or an optional 3D trajectory.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Phase I</p> <ul> <li> <p>Both groups must submit a Phase I Design Report not later than 31   December.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Phase I Design Video is optional, due not later than 15 January.</p> </li> <li> <p>Judges will review the reports and select finalists to be announced in   early February.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Phase II</p> <ul> <li>Teams will submit a pre-recorded team presentation approximately one   week before the Phase II test. Judges will review the presentation and   prepare a list of questions that will be asked of each team prior to   the physical test.</li> </ul> <p>Tests</p> <ul> <li>Group A and B Phase II tests will be held on separate dates, to be   advised in April. If possible, we will hold face-to-face tests in   Germany and the USA, with an option for a virtual meeting on the same   dates.</li> </ul> <p>The DSATS technical section believes that this challenge benefits students in several ways.\u00a0 Petroleum, mechanical, electrical, and control engineers gain hands-on experience in each person\u2019s area of expertise that forms a solid foundation for post-graduate careers. Those involved with system modeling gain insight into how models can gain sufficient fidelity to be applied to industry specific problems. They also learn where poor models or poor data can lead to incorrect outcomes. Students also develop experience working in multi-disciplinary teams, which is essential in today\u2019s technology-driven industries.\u00a0 Winning teams must possess a variety of skills.\u00a0 The mechanical and electrical engineers need to build a stable, reliable, and functional drilling rig.\u00a0 Control engineers need to architect a system for real-time control, including a selection of sensors, data handling, and fast-acting control algorithms.\u00a0 The petroleum engineers need an understanding of drilling dysfunctions and mitigation techniques.\u00a0 Modeling engineers must understand all of these basics and how to organize numerous modules into a complex model. Everyone must work collectively to establish functional system requirements, often fully understood by each team member to accurately portray the drilling issues and create an integrated package working seamlessly together.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry today seeks lower costs and reduced risk through efficiency and innovation.\u00a0 Many student competitors may discover innovative tools and control processes that will assist drillers in speeding the time to drill and complete a well.\u00a0 This includes more than a faster ROP, such as problem avoidance for dysfunctions like excessive vibrations, stuck pipe, and wellbore stability issues.\u00a0 Student teams built new downhole tools using 3D printing techniques of designs that would be difficult, if not impossible to machine.\u00a0 They used creative hoisting and lowering systems.\u00a0 Teams modeled drilling performance in particular formations and adjusted the drilling parameters accordingly for changing downhole conditions.\u00a0 While they have a lot to learn about our business, we have a lot to learn about their fresh approach to today\u2019s problems.

The team should preferably be     a multi-disciplinary team that will bring unique skills to the group     to allow them to design and construct hardware, software and models     to demonstrate that they understand the underlying physics, the     drilling issues and the usual means to mitigate the issues. We     cannot stress enough the need to involve students with different     technical training and backgrounds. They will need to develop skills     to understand drilling dysfunctions and mitigation strategies, but     they must also have the mechanical engineering and controls     capabilities to model, design the rig/drilling package and develop     the controls system. Even when the project involves only software,     an understanding of the physical limits of a rig\u2019s machinery and     tubulars is critical. In past years, some entrants have not     adequately considered the control network and algorithms needed for     autonomous drilling. They have often misunderstood the need for     calibrated sensors and fast, accurate data handling. Some teams did     not consider measurement errors. Teams from both Group A and B     ignored uncertainty principles. All of this and more is needed to     build and operate a complete automated drilling system. We encourage     all teams to start out with a simple concept done well, and then     build on it from year to year adding complexity when warranted.     Planning for this evolution will make it easier on future team     members.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students should produce novel ideas leading to new drilling     models, improved drilling machines and sensors, and the ability to     integrate the data, models and machines that will hopefully create     new, more efficient ways to drill wells in the future. Any such     innovation will belong to the students and their university in     accordance with the university\u2019s written policies. DSATS and SPE     waive any claims to students\u2019 intellectual property.</p> </li> <li> <p>The students, working as a multi-disciplinary team, will gain     hands-on experience that will be directly applicable to a career in     the upstream drilling industry.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["archive","2024","group-b"]},{"location":"2024/group-b/#background","title":"Background","text":"<ol> <li>What is DSATS?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS is a technical section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) organized to promote the adoption of automation techniques using surface and downhole machines and instrumentation to improve the safety and efficiency of the drilling process. More information is available about DSATS at the DSATS homepage.</p> <ol> <li>Why an international competition?</li> </ol> <p>DSATS and the other technical sections, as part of the SPE, are a group of volunteers from many nations, connected by their belief that drilling automation will have a long-term, positive influence on the drilling industry. This diversity helped to shape the direction of the organization. The group feels that the industry needs to attract young professionals from all cultures and disciplines to advance drilling practices in all areas of the world. The winners of the competition will receive a grant for economy class transportation and accommodations to attend the next SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and will present an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro<sup>1</sup>. Note that this year, the Drillbotics Committee will submit both Group A and Group B winning abstracts to the conference program committee. They will choose which of the two abstracts best fit their program. The Drillbotics committee will help the winning team from the other Group receive recognition of their achievement and have the opportunity via a different conference<sup>2</sup> to publish an SPE paper that will be added to the SPE archives of One Petro. DSATS believes recognition at one of the industry\u2019s leading technical conferences will demonstrate to industry leaders the extent of research and understanding the student teams have gained during the contest. Also, the practical experience with drilling automation systems increases the students\u2019 visibility to the companies that are leading automation activities.</p> <ol> <li>Why include a safety case</li> </ol> <p>Safety of personnel, equipment and the environment are always critical for any drilling operation. The industry begins any project or operation with safety in mind, and a safety case is a proven method of identifying and mitigating risks. This is no different on a small scale or for a virual operation. Safety goes far beyond personal protective equipment. Where can someone be hurt \u2013 in a lab with heavy rock samples and rotating machinery? Electrocution? High pressure leaks? Traveling to and from locations? Judges want to see how teams plan ahead in their first few meetings to identify threats and develop processes or devices to reduce the risk and severity of any incidents.</p> <ol> <li>Why include Human Factors?</li> </ol> <p>Any complex engineered system that is wholly reliant upon human operators to achieve its goal is likely to experience issues. Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation. Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your \u2018projected\u2019 drilling operator remains \u2018in the loop\u2019 through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition. It is imperative that teams show how they implemented human factors in their processes and interfaces, both in the creation of their rig or model and how the operators/judges will use their designs.</p> <p>Students working with automated systems should learn about the risks and proper strategies to allow humans and machines to work together safely and efficiently. Reference documents are listed in Appendix B. Requirements for human factors provisions are shown in Appendix A.</p> <ol> <li>Items posted on the website are part of these Guidelines</li> </ol> <p>The Drillbotics website at (https://drillbotics.com) includes official updates to the competition guidelines and schedule, as well as FAQs, photos, and previous entrants\u2019 submittals and reports and numerous reference documents. Any updates to the guidelines posted on the Drillbotics website via FAQs or blog entries from the Committee are considered to be an official revision to these Guidelines.</p> <ol> <li>Questions should be directed to the competition email at     competition@drillbotics.com.

Humans are inconsistent when performing monitoring tasks, they tend to not make wholly rational decisions, are impacted by external factors and are prone to error. As technology advances and complexity increases (such as the control regimes proposed in remote drilling operations for example) such issues become more prevalent. However, many of the issues associated with such complexity can be countered by reallocating certain tasks to automation.</p> <p>The concept that 'machines' (read automation) are better at some tasks than humans and vice versa has been prevalent for decades. The original incarnation of this notion was presented in 'Fitts List' [Ref. 1]. 'Fitts List' is 11 statements designed to provide guidance on 'what humans are best at' compared to 'what machines are best at' for example:</p> <p>Humans surpass machines in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to improvise and use flexible procedures'</li> </ul> <p>Machines surpass humans in respect to:</p> <ul> <li>'Their ability to handle highly complex operations i.e., to do many   different things at once'.</li> </ul> <p>Although Fitts List was originally published in 1951, the vast majority of the statements still ring true today (after all humans have changed very little in the last 70 years) but with advances in research and technology, automation is now viewed on a sliding scale (from wholly manual to wholly autonomous) This has recently been subject to consideration by the Drilling Systems Automation Roadmap who have chosen to adopt a 10-point level of automation taxonomy as follows [Ref. 2]:</p> <p>1. The computer offers no assistance, and the human must do it all</p> <p>2. The computer suggests alternative ways to do the task and the human selects from those suggestions and executes the task</p> <p>3. The computer selects one way to do the task, which triggers five possible scenarios including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the human executes that selection</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes that suggestion if the human approves</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer allows the human a restricted time to veto before   automatic execution</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically necessarily informs   the human</p> </li> <li> <p>the computer executes the suggestion automatically and informs the   human only if asked</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. The computer selects the method, executes the task, and ignores the human.</p> <p>Superficially, for highly complex systems, it may appear that there are very few downsides to providing very high levels of automation with little to no required user input. However, as is often stated, there is no such thing as a 'free lunch' and there are often overlooked downsides to providing high levels of automation usually termed the \u2018Ironies of Automation\u2019 [Ref. 3] which must be suitably managed. Two examples of this are:</p> <p>1. Any autonomous system is ultimately conceived and designed by humans \u2013 Attempts to design out the human merely shift the responsibility further up the chain. Operators involuntarily inherit the biases and Performance Shaping Factors that influenced the design team.</p> <p>2. The autonomous system cannot account for unforeseeable scenarios \u2013 This is one of the predominant reasons humans remain part of complex systems, to address the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019. However, expecting human operators to flip between a passive \u2018monitoring\u2019 role and an active \u2018doing\u2019 role is difficult to achieve, they may be \u2018out of the loop\u2019 and their Situation Awareness may be compromised.</p> <p>Maintaining appropriate levels of automation and ensuring that your \u2018projected\u2019 drilling operator remains \u2018in the loop\u2019 through good interface design will be one of the key challenges you will face in the Drillbotics competition.</p> <p>Resources</p> <p>The following resources have been selected to assist you in the design of your drilling interface and the levels of autonomy you decide upon. Where possible free resources have been chosen (either available through OnePetro or elsewhere on the Internet) but two textbooks have also been selected as they offer an excellent primer on usability heuristics and the importance of good design.</p> <p>1. de Winter JCF, Hancock PA.
